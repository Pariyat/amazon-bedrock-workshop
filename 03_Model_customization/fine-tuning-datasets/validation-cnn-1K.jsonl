Both fighters are subject to random, Olympic-style testing by USADA in the build up to their $300m (£200m) mega-fight in Las Vegas on May 2.

'Today we were informed that Mayweather turned down the request,' Michael Koncz told EPSN. 'Manny had requested that there would be a reciprocal fine of $5 million for a failed drug test.' The details of the testing were not written into the fight contract but were instead included in a separate agreement. And Mayweather's adviser Leonard Ellerbe said that was Pacquiao's mistake. 'Michael Koncz is an idiot, and Manny Pacquiao should be ashamed to have him as his representative, in my opinion,' he told ESPN. 'It's obvious he didn't read the contract.

Goals from Steven Naismith and Romelu Lukaku transformed Everton’s Europa League last 16 tie with Dynamo Kiev, giving Martinez’s side a lead to protect in Ukraine next week when it appeared they were set for another night of misery. Everton have fallen way below expectations in recent months and have only won one Barclays Premier League fixture in 2015 but Martinez is hoping they will carry the momentum from this victory into Sunday’s crucial Goodison Park fixture against Newcastle. Everton boss Roberto Martinez hopes his side can kick on in the Premier League after beating Dynamo Kiev . Oleg Gusev (right) volleyed Kiev ahead on Thursday night with a neat near post finish from a corner . Steven Naismith equalised in the first half for Everton with a curled right-footed finish . Romelu Lukaku scored the winner with a penalty on 82 minutes to give Everton a first leg 2-1 to take to Kiev . ‘It has to be a turning point,’ said Martinez. ‘Our fans know that we have got an honest group of players. When we get the tempo right and have that expression in our play, we have shown that we are a good team. ‘We need to focus on the league now and get the flow we had in our second half performance. You cannot underestimate how important it is to win in Europe. Our intensity was very pleasing. That was us at our best level. We know that we have got a good side.’ Things looked difficult when Oleg Gusev opened the scoring for Kiev, who have now failed to win in England in 12 attempts, but they struggled to contain Lukaku, who scored his seventh Europa League goal of the campaign. He echoed Martinez’s sentiments in hoping for a domestic spin-off. ‘I'm very happy with the team performance,’ said Lukaku. ‘The team reacted well after first half. We should have maybe scored three goals to be safe but they have top class players. It's up there with my best performances. Now we have to focus on the league as we are not doing too well. ‘Everyone up front was scared to have the ball and we put the defenders and the midfielders in danger, but after 20 minutes we improved. Now if we want to save the season we have to keep playing like this. We are favourites, but it will be difficult over there.’ Lukaku points to the heavens after converting his 82nd minute penalty to put Everton 2-1 ahead .", "completion": "response:\n\nEverton beat Dynamo Kiev 2-1 in their Europa League last 16 first leg tie .\nGoals from Steven Naismith and Romelu Lukaku gave Toffees victory .\nEverton host Newcastle in the Premier League on Sunday afternoon ."}

But for men, some elements of the vow can prove easier to keep than others. A study shows that a couple is more likely to divorce if the wife falls ill. The researchers said their results indicate that some men simply cannot cope with a poorly spouse. A study shows that a couple is more likely to divorce if the wife falls ill and researchers said their results indicate that some men simply cannot cope with a poorly spouse . After tracking 2,700 couples in the US from 1992 to 2010, the American team found that divorce levels were roughly the same between healthy couples and those in which the husband suffered sickness. But when disease hit the wife, the likelihood of divorce rose. Every two years the researchers interviewed the couples and asked whether either of them had been ill since their last session. Over the 18 years, 859 marriages ended in divorce, 32 per cent of the sample group. For 24 per cent of the couples, tragedy struck when one spouse died, and 44 per cent were still going strong by the time the study ended. But among the 965 couples in which the woman got sick, the rate of divorce was 6 per cent higher. Lead author Amelia Karraker, assistant professor in family studies at Iowa State University, said illness can add stress to a marriage because men may not be as attuned to taking on a caregiver role as women. ‘There is a difference between feeling too sick to make dinner and needing someone to actually feed you,’ she said. ‘That’s something that can really change the dynamics within a marriage. If your spouse is too sick to work, we know that financial strain is a major predictor of divorce.’ Dr Karraker said wives may also become dissatisfied with their husbands’ ability to look after them. She added: ‘Life or death experiences may cause people to re-evaluate what is important in their lives. ‘It could be that women are saying, “You’re doing a bad job of caring for me or I wasn’t happy with the relationship to begin with, and I’d rather be alone than in a bad marriage.”’ The research was published in the Journal of Health and Social Behaviour.", "completion": "response:\n\nThe study monitored 2,700 couples in the US from 1992 to 2010 .\nResearchers say some men simply cannot cope with a poorly spouse .\nLead author says 'men may not be as attuned to taking on a caregiver role'"}

Images of parents and family members clambering up school buildings and clinging on window ledges to pass cheat sheets to their children have left authorities in despair. The incident took place on Wednesday in the state of Bihar, where students were writing their year-end grade 10 examinations. Examples of cheating incidents are not hard to find in India. But, even compared to previous events, this seems to be unprecedented in its blatancy. Bihar Education Minister PK Shahi told reporters that children won't learn if they're constantly helped by family members. \"Government can only hold fair examinations with the help of the parents, society and the children,\" he said. \"This is a collective responsibility.\" In a developing economy like India, education is a precious commodity. With more than 1.2 billion people, proper schooling could hold the key for much of the population to get out of a vicious cycle of poverty. Earlier this week, a father in the city of Mathura was caught strapping his 8-year old daughter to a motorcycle after she refused to attend school to take her assessment. Tied with a multi-strand rope to the back of a bike, onlookers captured images of the trussed girl, her bare feet hanging low, scraping the asphalt. According to local police officials, the girl's parents offered her several incentives, such as chocolates and toys to entice her, however when the girl was still reluctant, her father decided to take matters in his own hands. After photos started making the rounds on social media, police officials took the man into custody and charged him with \"breach of the peace.\" He is now out on bail. \"Even after he got out, the father showed no remorse. He has five children to feed and he believes the only way they can get out of this poverty trap is through education,\" a senior police official handling the case told CNN. The flaws in India's education system are well-documented. The country has a literacy rate of only 74%, compared to 95% in China. Women suffer particularly badly here; only 64% have formal education. Earlier this year, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a nationwide campaign urging parents to send their children, especially daughters, to school and properly educate them.

Sportsmail can reveal that Pietersen has told Surrey, who released him at the end of last summer, that he will not play all county cricket for them next season — even though he was urged to do so when offered a lifeline by new ECB chairman Colin Graves. He appeared to call Pietersen’s bluff by saying the 34-year-old would be considered for an England recall if he threw his lot in with a county and stated his case by scoring heavily in domestic cricket. Kevin Pietersen played for Surrey in last year's Natwest Twenty20 Blast . Yet it seems unlikely the county will be Surrey, who have not been able to reach agreement with Pietersen over a deal to play in red-ball cricket as well as the white-ball game. The fact Pietersen struggled to attract a contract in this year’s Indian Premier League, before Sunrisers Hyderabad signed him in a cut-price deal, seemed to suggest the path may be clear for a return to domestic cricket. But unless Pietersen is prepared to move away from London — something he previously stated he would not do — it seems that his options are diminishing. Leicestershire may take on Pietersen but it remains to be seen if he will deign to play in the second division. A return for Pietersen in England colours (above) is now looking more and more unlikely . Somerset, coached by Pietersen’s friend Matt Maynard, remain an option but the odds are against him being given a platform to stake a claim for England. Graves, who does not succeed Giles Clarke as chairman until May 15, appeared to go against the wishes of senior figures in the England set-up when he seemed to endorse a Pietersen recall.

Captured by South African photographer Mark Dumbleton, the lioness began by circling her prey before her cubs joined the hunt. The animal fought back - but outnumbered and separated from the herd, it was only a matter of time before it was overpowered.

The Budget has failed to provide a Tory bounce – but if the economy stays on track until the Election, David Cameron (pictured) could still win . A total of 13 per cent of Labour supporters opted for Cameron, but only 2 per cent of Tories choose Miliband. The Survation poll carried out for The Mail on Sunday shows Labour on 34 points, the Tories on 30, Ukip on 17 and the Lib Dems on ten. A total of 1,008 people took part in the online survey on Friday and Saturday. Asked to choose between the Tories and Labour, Labour clearly wins. But when voters are asked to choose between Cameron and Miliband, Cameron wins by 42 per cent to 33. There have recently been claims by some Tory MPs that the Budget was ‘too dull’, and Australian-born Election guru Lynton Crosby has been criticised by Ministers including Michael Gove and Iain Duncan Smith for ‘lack of vision’.

Woods is taking an indefinite break from golf as he attempts to get his game 'tournament ready' after a poor run of form and injuries. Former Tour player Dan Olsen, who played in 35 Tour events between 1989 and 2011 - missing 22 cuts - alleged in an interview on US radio station 730AM The Game on Friday that Woods was serving a drugs ban, but on Monday retracted his claims and issued an apology to the 14-time major winner.

But a skier in Kiroro, Japan proved that you can’t always see the trees for the ski slope either after one appeared to come out of nowhere and wipe him out on a mountain. Videoed skiing towards a slight lip in the piste, the skier gets a remarkable amount of air as he propels himself into a forward flip. But as quickly as the footage begins looking impressive, it begins looking painful as he ploughs straight into a tree upon landing. The failed stunt is repeated twice more in slow motion, which shows in greater detail the moment the man spots the tree and braces for impact. Crashing into it, the tree’s branches sway violently and its entire dusting of snow disappears into the atmosphere. The skier approaches a slight gradient in the slope before he jumps up into the air to attempt a foward flip . A close up shot of the man in the tree shows how tangled within it he is as one of his skis looks genuinely stuck. He looks relatively okay however considering the force in which he collides with it. The clip concludes with a doctor at the hospital utilising a rather ingenious app that translates his Japanese into English. Hurtling through the air the skier gains a surprising amount of height and initially appears to be pulling off an impressive flip . He asks the man: ‘Are you dizzy?’ to which he replies with a nod, circling his face with his hand as if to indicate where he is feeling pain. The doctor, now sitting in front of what seem to be X-rays of the man’s skull, then appears to say: ‘Three days’. Perhaps suggesting the amount of time the man should refrain from skiing for. The man realises his mistake while hurtling through the air and braces himself for the impact of the crash . While not an obvious place to ski, Japan has some 600 ski resorts and some impressive sites including Niseko, known for its international clientele. Japanese slopes are not as steep as some of the better known places to ski, but they are generally much cheaper to enjoy. And because of the lack of tourism to the skiing areas, they are sometimes occupied by only a handful of people. Watch out for that...

Deadpool's costume, a favorite among comic book fans and convention cosplayers, includes a mask that covers the entire face, so we might not see the face of 2010's sexiest man for much of the movie. Reynolds played Deadpool in 2009's \"X-Men Origins: Wolverine,\" but he never wore the famous red and black attire. Instead, he wore an unremarkable black suit bearing none of the hallmarks of the costume worn in the comics.

In response to skepticism online who was beneath the mask, screenwriter Rhett Reese confirmed via Twitter that Reynolds was indeed in the suit. Then as a special treat for April Fools' Day, Reynolds was \"interviewed\" by \"Extra\" host Mario Lopez, about the debate over whether the movie should be rated PG-13 or R.

Governor Scott Walker once envisioned a world where the 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally could embark on a path to citizenship. But now the Wisconsin Republican calls that position 'amnesty' and says his view has changed. 'I don't believe in amnesty,' Walker told Fox News Sunday. 'My view has changed. I'm flat out saying it. Candidates can say that.' Walker, who emerged this past week in the top tier of potential candidates for the Republican presidential nomination for 2016, says the U.S. needs to secure the border and ultimately put in place 'a legal immigration system that works.' That means, in part, putting the onus on employers and getting them the tools to do that, like E-Verify, an existing federal program that allows businesses to check the immigration status of new hires, Walker said. Walker told the Wausau, Wisconsin, Daily Herald newspaper in 2013 that 'it makes sense' when he was asked whether he could see a world where 'those people' could get citizenship, with the right penalties, waiting periods and requirements in place. At the time, he supported a bipartisan approach to overhauling immigration, with people waiting to get citizenship having priority and others having a legal pathway to live here legally. Walker also said Sunday that President Barack Obama or 'anybody else who is willing to put their name on the ballot certainly has to have the love for country to do that.'

The security forces, backed by Shia militias, raised the Iraqi flag over the governorate and the main hospital buildings in the city Monday night, a security official with the forces in Tikrit told CNN. The gains, according to the official, came after a slow advance into the city as the forces dealt with more than 300 improvised explosive devices planted in the city's streets. At least 26 militants were killed in the operation, the official said. Earlier Monday, Iraqi federal police said in a statement aired on Iraqi television that the forces had liberated four neighborhoods in southern Tikrit. The renewed push into Tikrit comes days after a series of U.S.-led airstrikes aimed at ISIS targets around the city. The goal of those airstrikes was to pave the way for Iraqi forces to go in. Now security forces and fighters from Hashd Al-Shaabi, a predominantly Shia paramilitary force that has doing much of the fighting in the critical battle to take Tikrit back from ISIS, say they're gaining ground. Iraqi forces have tried multiple times to win back Tikrit since ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, conquered the city in June as part of its campaign to amass an expansive Islamic caliphate. And each time, so far, they've failed. The latest push began after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on March 1 ordered Iraqi forces to retake Tikrit and Salahuddin province. Militants have been under pressure ever since in the battleground city, which is the birthplace of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and  located about 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of Baghdad. ISIS responded by adjusting its positions in and around the city, hiding in buildings and other key infrastructure, said Saad al-Hadithi, a spokesman for al-Abadi. This movement led Iraq's military to pause its operation, out of growing worries that a full-on invasion could produce heavy Iraqi military and some civilian casualties. The situation spurred the Iraqi Prime Minister to request help from the U.S.-led coalition, which conducted airstrikes around Tikrit last week. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh, Catherine E. Shoichet,  Ashley Fantz, Ben Wedeman and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.", "completion": "response:\n\nA push to retake Tikrit stalled as ISIS repositioned its forces around the city .\nSpokesman: Iraq's leader requested help because coalition has \"advanced\" capabilities .\nLeaders of predominantly Shiite militia fighting in area had resisted such intervention ."}

Getting closer and closer, the head bison shows no signs of adjusting its path and instead positions itself to line up with the car’s front bumper.

As the bison gets  closer it shows no signs of adjusting its path and instead positions itself to line up with the car’s front bumper .

'Instead, at the last minute, the lead bison veers to his left and intentionally head-butts our car. There was nothing we could do to avoid being hit.’ He added: 'It was fortunate that the car was turned off, since a head-on collision with a 2,000 pound bison moving at 10mph  would  likely cause the airbags to deploy.'

Bursting the balloon instantly, the snake comes incredibly close to puncturing the man's face. The viper then retreats back to its original position and Duarte begins to blow up another balloon. Arteval Duarte is known locally as the ‘Ninja of Serpents’ because of his many filmed encounters with snakes . Duarte moves closer to the Boa Constrictors while blowing up a balloon, causing one of them to strike . He repeats the dangerous feat three more times – the two snakes taking it in turns to pop the balloons as he compliments their intelligence. The video concludes with the snake ninja approaching the constrictors on the table and after dodging another lunge, grabbing and holding onto them. According to Duarte, the two snakes have been trained to obey his commands and bursting balloons from his mouth like this appears to be something they are used to doing. The motive for the stunt is in apparent protest against the deforestation of the Amazon. The mouth of the snake that bursts the balloon is only inches away from puncturing Duarte's face . Duarte blows up a total of four balloons and the two snakes appear to take it in turns bursting them . Arteval has specialised in performing bizarre stunts with snakes for 15 years to protest the deforestation of the Amazon . Arteval says that he dedicates his life to protecting the habitats of animals and that his videos bring attention to the problems. Specialising in bizarre stunts for over 15 years, Arteval has also been recorded putting tarantulas and scorpions in his mouth. He has been bitten by many snakes in his time, which may give an explanation for the bandage on his arm.", "completion": "response:\n\nA pair of snakes lunge at daredevil Arteval Duarte as he blows up balloon .\nHolding it in his mouth one snake lurches forward, popping it with its fangs .\nThe snake ninja repeats this highly dangerous feat three more times .\nThe Brazilian creates videos to protest against Amazon deforestation ."}

The 85-year-old former NASA astronaut, who touched down on the moon in 1969 with Neil Armstrong, posted a picture on Twitter of himself in front of England's Stonehenge, wearing a T-shirt reading, 'Get your a** to Mars'. 'While at @EH_Stonehenge yesterday I decided to send a message to the cosmos,' he wrote on Tuesday, accompanying the photo. Buzz Aldrin posed in front of Stonehenge in a T-shirt reading, 'Get your a** to Mars' on Monday, claiming he was sending 'a message to the cosmos' Stonehenge, a prehistoric ring of standing stones, dates back to between 3,000 and 2,000 BC. Aldrin's picture is the last move in his campaign for the U.S. to focus on having human settlement on Mars. The veteran astronaut has written a series of columns stressing that space exploration should continue. Aldrin has stressed numerous times over the years that space exploration needs to continue and the U.S. needs to have a goal of settling on Mars . He wrote in CNN last year: 'The moment to begin could be on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11's touchdown on the moon. 'We can make a courageous, Kennedyesque commitment to America's future in deep space. 'The U.S. President could utter these momentous words: \"I believe this nation should commit itself, within two decades, to commencing an America-led, permanent presence on the planet Mars.\"' In November of last year, he wrote a column for TIME, stressing that more people need to touch down in space. He wrote: 'I firmly believe we will establish permanence on that planet. And in reaching for that goal, we can cultivate commercial development of the moon, the asteroid belt, the Red Planet itself and beyond… . 'We need to look forward to countries around the globe following our lead and establishing a rotating permanence on Mars for science and commercial resources. 'Some 45 years ago, when Neil Armstrong and I stepped upon the surface of the moon at Tranquility Base, we fulfilled a dream held by humankind for centuries. 'Yes, it was one small step.

As usual, there have been a number of people who have said 'it is the worst thing that can happen on a pitch'; it is vile but let me assure you now – I would have preferred Lucas Neill to have spat at me the day he broke my leg in September 2003! I was spat at once in my career. It came during a UEFA Cup game against Celta Vigo in 1998 and the player in question was a Russian midfielder called Aleksander Mostovoi. I was shocked more than angry when he did it because I couldn't believe what had happened. The issue of spiting in football has, sadly, raised its head again after Jonny Evans and Papiss Cisse clashed . Evans appears to launch spit in the direction of the Newcastle United striker, who then retaliates . The only time Carragher was spat on was in a UEFA Cup game against Celta Vigo in 1998 . Louis van Gaal is getting results, it's time for everyone to get off the Manchester United manager's back... CLICK HERE to read on. Cisse has admitted being in the wrong and hit with a seven-game ban. I know it is a disgusting thing to do but I do think that punishment seems a little excessive, particularly if you compare it to an over-the-top tackle that would 'only' get three games. For Evans, the incident doesn't look good at all. It would have been easy enough for him to spit well away from Cisse. One final thing: all those people who have said about Evans 'he's not that type of lad'. Who is then? Is there are a list somewhere of names who are 'that type'? It is a stupid thing to say. It's not about his character. It's about whether he had a moment of madness, deliberately or not. Blackburn Rovers defender Lucas Neill is sent off after breaking Carragher's leg in September 2003 .

Labadie served a 10-match ban and was fined £2,000 in March 2014 for biting Chesterfield's Ollie Banks in a League Two match while playing for Torquay - a charge which he denied. Westley claimed Henry was 'horrified' by Saturday's alleged incident which happened shortly before full-time and said: 'I think it has become a police matter and when it becomes a police matter anybody in a responsible position should let it be dealt with by the authorities. Stevenage's Ronnie Henry (in the white) accused Dagenham midfielder Joss Labadie of biting him . 'So in passing comment, word is around the place that there's been an incident and the police are involved. He's (Henry) not in a good situation, he's in the treatment room and he's suffered quite a nasty injury. 'Ronnie was in a state of shock, you don't go on a football pitch expecting to lose your finger and Ronnie was horrified by what has gone on because it's a football match and he's nearly lost his finger.' The game had already threatened to boil over before Labadie and Henry's clash due to the nature of Dagenham's winning goal. Labadie was clearly offside when a long ball was played forwards in his direction yet he did not touch it, Christian Doidge took over and crossed for Dean Howell to score. But only after long consultation with his assistant did referee Dean Whitestone award the goal. Stevenage manager Graham Westley said that the alleged incident had become a 'police matter' In November 2010, Luis Suarez was handed a seven-match ban by the Dutch FA and a fine by his then-club Ajax for biting PSV Eindhoven's Otman Bakkal. Suarez then bit Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic - his second victim - and the FA charged the then-Liverpool striker with violent conduct. He received a 10-game ban and a fine from his club. Then, Suarez was found guilty of biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini at the 2014 World Cup. The Barcelona forward was banned from all 'football-related activities' for four months and received a nine international match suspension.

A thief has been jailed after he is believed to have swallowed an £8,500 chunky diamond ring when arrested by police. Officers said they saw Rayhanur Choudhury with a silver 'glint' in his mouth when they went to arrest him after being called to Exclusive Jewellery in Brighton. The 22-year-old was fed five or six meals a day in a police cell with no flushing toilet in a bid to get him to pass the ring, which was fully set with emerald-cut diamonds. However nothing has been found. He was convicted of theft and jailed for nine months, following a hearing at Brighton Crown Court. Police were called to the store in November last year after Choudhury started trying on rings while staff were distracted. Lilly Jordan, a shop assistant, suspected he had swapped the 18-carat white gold ring for a fake alternative. She told the court: 'I counted the rings and there were five but one seemed out of place. 'It stuck out like a sore thumb.' Sabina Palermo, the manager of the store, said at the time: 'The missing ring is very chunky and certainly not something you would want to swallow.' CCTV footage showed Choudhury tilt his head back during the struggle with police. PC English said: 'He opened his mouth wide and I saw briefly the distinctive glint of something inside. 'I believe I saw something silver, an object that shouldn't have been there.' Choudhury, of Newhaven, East Sussex, denied the theft and the ring was never found. The ring was taken from Exclusive Jewellery in Brighton as Choudhury browsed the jewellery on display . He told the court he had explained to officers he was unwell so he could have an X-ray at hospital to prove he had not swallowed the ring. Alec Williams, prosecuting, said: 'It's a straightforward, not particularly sophisticated con trick, a switch.'

Aaron Lennon sank Rangers with a 77th-minute winner to move Everton up to 13th in the Barclays Premier League and nine points clear of the relegation places. Everton have been accused of being too soft this season after failing to replicate last year's fifth-place finish, but Osman insists they showed their mettle with a battling display at Loftus Road. Leon Osman believes Everton's win over QPR on Sunday shows the Toffees can win ugly when needed . Osman points at goalscorer Seamus Coleman after the defender had fired Everton ahead at Loftus Road . 'Certain games sometimes call for certain styles of play and the way the game goes dictates how you end up playing,' Osman said. 'Every time we lost the ball it was sent up to the edge of our box so we had to fight and scrap for second balls. 'It was a scrappy match defensively but we proved we can do that side of the game and then once you've done that, you have the opportunity to hit teams on the counter attack, which we tried to do. 'There was probably not as much football played as we usually like but there's no problem winning like that as well.' Aaron Lennon (left) celebrates after scoring the winning goal for Everton against Queens Park Rangers . The victory was Everton's second in a row in the league and saw Roberto Martinez's side bounce back from a disappointing 5-2 Europa League defeat to Dynamo Kiev on Thursday. 'It was a massive win for us after we suffered a big disappointment in the week,' Osman continued. 'It hasn't quite happened in the league this season so to put back-to-back wins together was really important for us. 'We were terrific at the back, especially Phil Jagielka. I thought he was at his best and we dealt with all their situations quite well. The winger slots home the crucial goal to move the Toffees closer to safety with the win at Loftus Road . 'It was always going to be difficult with the pitch as it is and with the way they played. 'They made it difficult for us but we stood up to that challenge head on and came away with a victory.

The U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Department of Interior this week shared a photo of a Weddell seal nuzzling up to what looked to be its mom in Erebus Bay, Antarctica. The expression of the mother is priceless. The photo was taken in October by USGS scientist William Link. Link, a statistician, was helping researchers tag newborn seal pups. He confirmed Friday that the adult seal was the baby's mom. It's hard to know what she was thinking when her baby nuzzled up to her in this photo, but Link said the animals flare their noses when disturbed, \"so this Mom was pretty relaxed,\" Link told CNN Friday. \"I have a great shot a few seconds later where Mom yawned hugely. She looked utterly content, to me.\" The agency's public affairs department had asked scientists for interesting images to post on social media. As the Instagram caption notes, the Weddell seals of Erebus Bay have been studied extensively for over 40 years. \"Because of its isolation, this population is undisturbed by human activities. The Weddell seal population is healthy and stable, and thus gives a good example for studies of animal population dynamics.\" Link said it was a privilege to see the animals up close. \"I was awed,\" he said. \"It's incredible that animals can live and thrive in such harsh conditions. It's hard to describe the remoteness and isolation of the spot -- bitter cold, high winds, no life to be seen except for the seals, an occasional skua or an emperor penguin.\" After a seal pup is born, Link said its mom spends all her time close to her baby in a very small area, with hardly any interaction with other seals. \"Mom doesn't even leave for a swim until the baby is nearly ready to be weaned, and even then doesn't get to eat. So while baby puts on a couple of hundred pounds, Mamma loses about twice that much,\" he said.

I went there as a youngster in 1986 and won with Arsenal and during the Arsene Wenger years we had a team that could go and win anywhere. We were a physical team but we could play, and it was almost a compliment when United tried to match our physicality.

Arsenal could have won the double but United went on to win the treble. Andy Cole made a run to drag me out of position, but sometimes you just have to admire moments of genius. The other game people love to remind me of is the ‘Battle of Old Trafford’ in 2003. In the little black book of opposition players, Ruud van Nistelrooy was one not to be trusted. He was a top player and a fighter, but he would look for any reason to go down. Perhaps I overreacted, but the whole team was infuriated by him. And I’m still not convinced I deserved to give away the penalty that Ruud eventually missed!

Police told a pensioner that they were too busy to deal with speeders using his road – but turned up within 30 minutes after he put up a DIY warning sign. Officers in Newbury, Berkshire, claimed they ‘did not have the resources’ to monitor motorists outside pensioner Richard Baker’s terraced home. So he made a ‘Max Speed 20mph’ sign and stuck it on the roadside –only to find an officer on his doorstep demanding that he remove the notice half an hour later. Mr Baker, 71, said he and his partner Rosemary Cribb fear someone will be knocked down and killed by the ‘mad’ drivers. ‘No one will do anything about the speeding, but put up an illegal sign and all of a sudden you get the police banging on your door,’ he said. ‘All I want to do is stop people speeding before there’s a tragedy – somebody’s got to do something about it. 'West Berkshire Council says it’s not their fault, and Thames Valley Police told me they haven’t got the time or resources. ‘But they can very soon find the time to send someone round to knock on my front door. ‘I put up the sign and inside 30 minutes an officer was round here telling me to take it down. ‘I’m just so frustrated – has it got to take someone’s death for them to do anything about the speeding traffic?’ 'West Berkshire Council says it’s not their fault, and Thames Valley Police told me they haven’t got the time or resources,' Mr Baker said .

He said: ‘This morning a woman complained to my daughter that it isn’t 20 along this road, it’s 30mph. She came back and said she was totally unaware it was 20mph.’ A police spokesman said they would investigate Mr Baker’s complaints.", "completion": "response:\n\nPolice said they were too busy to monitor drivers in Richard Baker's road .\nPensioner made a 'Max Speed 20mph' sign and stuck it on the roadside .\nOfficer arrived at doorstep 30 minutes later demanding he remove notice .\nMr Baker, 71, and partner fear someone will be knocked down and killed ."}

Teresa Erickson, 52, and her husband Dale, 59, were driving their pickup in the opposite direction when they were unable to avoid the hay. Mr Erickson's car was forced into a ditch and burst into flames. Killed: Dale Erickson, 59, and Teresa Erickson, 52, died within days of each other after their vehicle crashed into a ditch on County Road 9 and caught fire on Saturday morning after they were hit by a bale of hay . Scene of the crash: The couple passed the truck carrying the hay along a curve on Houston County Road 9 northeast of Houston, Minnesota just after 9 a.m. on Saturday . The couple were airlifted to hospital in Wisconsin however Mrs Erickson died soon after the accident and her husband passed away earlier this week. The semi that caused the crash was driven by Randall Hongerholt, 49, of Houston, according to the state patrol. He was not injured but according to the Minnesota State Patrol, charges are pending following the outcome of an investigation into the crash. 'Commercial vehicles, and all vehicles, are required to secure their load in a manner that prevents any of it's load from dropping, shifting, leaking, blowing or otherwise escaping from the vehicle,' said Patrol Lt. Tiffani Nielson. 'This fatal crash, unfortunately, is exactly why we have these laws in place — to prevent injuries or death. 'This was a very tragic crash, and a family is grieving a terrible loss that could have been prevented.' Hay bales vary greatly in weight, depending not only on dimensions but density. A federal study analyzed seven deaths in Minnesota in the mid-1990s associated with large hay bales and found that the bales ranged from 750 to 1,500 pounds. In Minnesota, truckers can be fined $385 if they are found to have an improperly secured or shifting load.", "completion": "response:\n\nAs truck went around a curve on a road in Minnesota it lost its load of hay A pickup headed in the opposite direction was hit by one of the bales .\nDale Erickson, 59, and his wife, 52-year-old Teresa Erickson were killed .\nThe driver of the semi-truck Randall Hongerholt was not injured ."}

Coyote populations are increasing throughout New Jersey as the creature, once confined to the West, continues to migrate through the Canadian Great Lakes region and towards New England. Ms Sofer said the coyotes had been using the doghouse since Saturday and could be seen leaving early in the mornings, NBC New York reported. Her daughter Maayan said: 'One time I even thought it was my mom screaming. It's so loud it's like shrieking noises. It is really scary.' The animals have adapted to living in close quarters with humans and have learned to navigate tasks associated with built-up areas - such as crossing busy roads and avoiding cars. Over the past few years they have spread to nearly every corner of the United States - wreaking havoc by preying on domestic pets and even attacking children.

Last summer, Sonic Drive-In launched a line-up of Slush drinks with Nerds candy mixed in. They were so popular the chain says some people ask to get the crunchy little candies mixed into other drinks, like soda. And given their success, CEO Cliff Hudson says Sonic is looking at adding a second candy-drink mashup this summer, although he declined to provide details.

In the meantime, the Nerds are still on menus as a drink add-in for around 30 cents. Already, a medium Grape Slush has 73 grams of sugar and 230 calories.  Add in the Nerds, and it has 130 grams of sugar and 510 calories. Sonic, which has more than 3,500 locations, notes it also offers plenty of lower-calorie drink choices, such as sparkling water with the option to add in various fresh fruits and flavors. Drinks have been a big part of Sonic's growth strategy, with the company letting people mix and match flavors and offering them at half price between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. The company says drinks now represent 30 percent of its total sales. That's compared to an average of about 22 percent for the overall fast-food industry, according to Technomic. More broadly, Sonic has been increasing sales in part by revamping recipes, such as for its chicken sandwich. In the most recent quarter that ended on Feb. 28, the company said sales rose 11.5 percent at established locations. That's following an 8.5 percent increase in the previous quarter, and a 3.5 percent increase for its last fiscal year. Order up!

SAE's national chapter suspended the students, but University of Oklahoma President David Boren took it a step further, saying the university's affiliation with the fraternity is permanently done. The news is shocking, but it's not the first time SAE has faced controversy. SAE was founded March 9, 1856, at the University of Alabama, five years before the American Civil War, according to the fraternity website. When the war began, the group had fewer than 400 members, of which \"369 went to war for the Confederate States and seven for the Union Army,\" the website says. The fraternity now boasts more than 200,000 living alumni, along with about 15,000 undergraduates populating 219 chapters and 20 \"colonies\" seeking full membership at universities. SAE has had to work hard to change recently after a string of member deaths, many blamed on the hazing of new recruits, SAE national President Bradley Cohen wrote in a message on the fraternity's website. The fraternity's website lists more than 130 chapters cited or suspended for \"health and safety incidents\" since 2010. At least 30 of the incidents involved hazing, and dozens more involved alcohol. However, the list is missing numerous incidents from recent months. Among them, according to various media outlets: Yale University banned the SAEs from campus activities last month after members allegedly tried to interfere with a sexual misconduct investigation connected to an initiation rite. Stanford University in December suspended SAE housing privileges after finding sorority members attending a fraternity function were subjected to graphic sexual content. And Johns Hopkins University in November suspended the fraternity for underage drinking. \"The media has labeled us as the 'nation's deadliest fraternity,' \" Cohen said. In 2011, for example, a student died while being coerced into excessive alcohol consumption, according to a lawsuit. SAE's previous insurer dumped the fraternity. \"As a result, we are paying Lloyd's of London the highest insurance rates in the Greek-letter world,\" Cohen said. Universities have turned down SAE's attempts to open new chapters, and the fraternity had to close 12 in 18 months over hazing incidents.", "completion": "response:\n\nSigma Alpha Epsilon is being tossed out by the University of Oklahoma .\nIt's also run afoul of officials at Yale, Stanford and Johns Hopkins in recent months ."}

A lifesaving vaccine against meningitis B could be given to babies for just £20 a dose – but it has yet to be introduced because the NHS has failed to agree a price after nine months of negotiations. Bexsero, the first jab to protect against the leading cause of life-threatening bacterial meningitis, was recommended for all infants as part of a national immunisation programme in March 2014. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said approval was subject to a cost-effective price being agreed between the manufacturer and the Department of Health, with talks beginning in July 2014. The maximum price being considered under negotiations is around £20 – a significant saving compared with GlaxoSmithKline's 'list price' of £75. Children need three doses in the first year of life, making the maximum final bill for the 700,000 born each year in England and Wales £42million. GPs are also paid a £7.50 fee for each dose administered. Campaigners have warned the lack of urgency from health officials is costing lives. Meningitis B can kill a healthy child within hours of the first symptoms. Since the vaccine was licensed two years ago there have been 1,130 cases, of which at least 452 people died or suffered disabilities. Chris Head, chief executive of the Meningitis Research Foundation, said: 'These price negotiations have been ongoing since July 2014. 'Meanwhile babies and children continue to die or suffer devastating injury, with lifelong costs to the government of someone seriously disabled from the disease ranging from £3million to £4.5million.' Earlier this week Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he wanted to introduce the vaccine on the NHS as soon as possible but his hands will be tied by General Election 'purdah' after the middle of next week. A Department of Health spokesman said: 'We are very clear that we want to see this vaccine introduced as soon as possible to help protect children from this devastating disease – but only at a price that represents good value for money for the NHS.'

But, after millennia in which the mummies have remained well preserved, those ancient remains are now in danger of rapid decomposition, Harvard scientists have warned. The culprit? According to the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, in a news report published Monday, rising humidity that helps microbes flourish on the mummies' skin is to blame.

It involved removing the brain and organs, replacing them with natural fiber and ash, stitching the body back up with reeds and covering the skin with a paste of manganese, ocher or brown mud, depending on the period. The Chinchorro people mummified human remains for more than 3,000 years. The oldest of the mummies date back some 2,000 years before the ancient Egyptians mummified their pharaohs.

When the time came to reveal to the Academy that Iñárritu had triumphed, Penn asked 'Who gave this son of a bitch his green card?' before announcing his film as the winner. The joke prompted a storm of outrage from critics who branded the comments xenophobic - but Penn has today said he has 'absolutely no apologies' and that the only reason anyone could be offended is their own 'flagrant stupidity'. Scroll down for video . 'Who gave that son of a bitch a green card?': Sean Penn, left, was criticized for a joke he directed at Alejandro Iñárritu, right, while handing him an Oscar. He called the reaction 'flagrant stupidity' According to Penn, the jibe was part of his friendship with Iñárritu, with whom he has worked in the past - and even a way to let him know of his victory seconds before everyone else. Speaking at a promo event in Beverly Hills for one of his own movies, Penn said of the reaction to the joke: 'I'm always surprised by flagrant stupidity. I keep having more hope.' He later added: 'I have absolutely no apologies'. 'In fact, I have a big [expletive] you for every...anybody who is so stupid not to have gotten the irony when you've got a country that is so xenophobic.

'I make on him a lot of very tough jokes that I will not tell you,' Iñárritu added. While Iñárritu's casual dismissal of any perceived offense helped to temper the public response to the comment, Penn has remained largely silent on the topic.

But we can settle another long-running geek debate: . Those short, animated loops that have captivated the Web for decades? They're pronounced like a brand of peanut butter. Steve Wilhite created the Graphics Interchange Format, or GIF, while working for Compuserve in 1987. When he received a Webby Award in 2013 for it, and delivered his five-word acceptance speech (that's all the Webbys allow), he flashed a GIF on the big screens at the Cipriani Wall Street in New York. And, in a flash, it all became clear: . \"It's pronounced JIF, not GIF.\" Of course, in the grand tradition of heated debate, a flat statement of fact by the creator wasn't enough to sway some partisans. On Twitter, \"GIF\" became a trending topic as some folks pushed back. \"Graphics Interchange Format. Graphics. Not Jraphics. #GIF #hardg,\" wrote Web designer Dan Cederholm. \"So instead of GIF, we've got to say JIF? YEAH RIGHT,\" chimed in October Jones, creator of the \"Texts From Dog\" Tumblr and book. \"And I suppose those animals with long necks are called 'JIRAFFES.'\" And, of course, the peanut butter brand was getting lots of free publicity along the way.

Animated GIFs were a staple of the early Internet. Remember The Dancing Baby? That's a GIF. They fell out of favor as more advanced graphics technology emerged. But in the past couple of years, the Web has remembered how much fun it is to watch ridiculous things happen over and over again. Wilhite has argued for the soft-G pronunciation for years. Yet no less an authority than the White House has posted an image on its Tumblr feed advocating for the hard-G. And the Oxford English Dictionary says both pronunciations are acceptable.

The agency has paid researchers $15,000 (around £10,000) to develop a wireless device for monitoring water use in hotel room showers. 'Hotels consume a significant amount of water in the U.S. and around the world,' says a proposal on the EPA's website. The gadget will fit onto hotel shower fixtures and transmit  data back to an accounting system using an app . 'Most hotels do not monitor individual guest water usage and as a result, millions of gallons of potable water are wasted every year by hotel guests.' Which is why they want to create an app to monitor the amount of water hotel guests are using - and, they hope, compel people to shorten their shower time by a minute. The gadget will fit onto existing hotel shower fixtures and transmit water usage data back to a central hotel accounting system using an app, which it is hoped will be doled out in major hotel chains. It will be made up of a flow metre, an embedded system and software, and a resource accounting system, and will allow  hotel guests to monitor their daily water online or using a smartphone app. The EPA has paid researchers $15,000 (around £10,000) to develop a wireless device for monitoring water use . The proposal will be marketed to the hotel industry to reduce costs by promoting water conservation among hotel guests. The current average length of shower is estimated to be 8.2 minutes or 17.2 gallons - but it's unknown how hotels will encourage guests to limit this. A spokesperson for the EPA told The Washington Free Beacon that calling for the device was not intended to enable the monitoring of guests shower time. 'It’s ultimately up to hotels to use technology like the monitors being developed at the University of Tulsa. EPA is encouraging creativity with water conservation efforts,' they said.", "completion": "response:\n\nU.S researchers given £10,000 to develop a device to monitor shower use .\nEnvironmental Protection Agency want to save millions of gallons of water .\nIt hopes hotel guest will reduce their shower times by up to one minute ."}

There were just 22 cases of meningitis W in 2009, but this shot up to 117 last year, according to Public Health England. This is a rise of 431 per cent. Some experts said the levels could even indicate a public health emergency. While the rise was initially seen in adults, it has now extended to all age groups and, for the first time in a decade, young children have died as a result of MenW. There has also been a rise in cases among students. It is proposed to immunise teenagers aged 14 to 18 in an attempt to halt the disease’s spread. Andrew Pollard, chairman of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said the upsurge in cases was caused by a ‘highly aggressive strain of the bug’. He said: ‘We reviewed the outbreak in detail and concluded that this increase was likely to continue in future years unless action is taken. ‘We have therefore advised the Department of Health to implement a vaccination programme for teenagers as soon as possible which we believe will have a substantial impact on the disease and protect the public’s health.’ Campaigners said the Government’s delay in introducing a vaccine against meningitis B – the last major strain of the disease – may have hindered the fight. Statistics show one baby dies every month in Britain from meningitis B and charities claim dozens of lives have needlessly been lost to the disease because of procrastination by officials. Chris Head, of the Meningitis Research Foundation, said: ‘We applaud the quick action by the Government to protect 14 to 18-year-olds using the MenACWY vaccine. ‘However, it will take more than a year for this protection to filter through to toddlers and infants, and in the meantime under-fives will still be dying and disabled as a result of MenW.’", "completion": "response:\n\nThere were 117 cases of meningitis W in 2014 compared to 22 in 2009 .\nSome experts claim the rise could indicate a public health emergency .\nFor the first time some young children have died as a result of MenW ."}

Meanwhile, De Bruyne's Wolfsburg team-mate Marcel Schafer has urged the 23-year-old to stay for at least another season. He told reporters: 'I think that our chances [of keeping De Bruyne] are really good. He has already experienced not getting so much time on the field at Chelsea, a top club in Europe. Jose Mourinho deemed De Bruyne surplus to requirements at Stamford Bridge last year . 'And that is why I think the best thing for him would be to stay for minimum one more year at Wolfsburg. Next year he could play Champions League here and win titles with us. 'If you want to win titles you need extraordinary players.

Hastings Magistrates Court heard that the pet was also covered in sores, and was suffering from a lung condition due to a lack of worming. Rosemary Robinson, 41, and daughter Rachel, 19, have been banned from keeping any animals for five years after starving pet pointer cross George . The dog was so emaciated he was able to tuck his back legs up under his ribcage, and was also covered in sores and masses, according to the RSPCA .

Neither of the owners, from St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, turned up to the hearing, and so were sentenced in their absence to a multitude of animal welfare offences. Rosemary was also given a community order for six months, a six month curfew and made to pay £1,063 costs and fines. Rachel was handed a 12-month community order, 100 hours unpaid work and ordered to pay £763 in costs and fines. The RSPCA was called with concern in February after George was finally taken to a vet.

It is the fifth portrait of the British monarch to be used on coins during her 63-year reign. Production of the new coins began Monday, and they will appear in circulation later this year, the Royal Mint said. The new design depicts the Queen wearing the royal diamond diadem crown from her coronation. Artist Jody Clark said he researched images online when deciding which crown to use. \"I think it's the most familiar and I wanted to make some clear distinctions between the (most recent) portrait by Ian Rank-Broadley FRBS, as Her Majesty really hasn't aged too much in the years since.\" \"FRBS\" refers to Rank-Broadley's fellowship in the Royal British Society of Sculptors, a professional organization that advances the art of sculpture. A panel selected Clark's design from a number by specialist designers across Britain invited to submit anonymous work. The design was then submitted to the British chancellor and the Queen for final approval. Clark is a member of the Royal Mint's team of designers and engravers. He is the first mint engraver to produce a definitive royal coinage portrait in more than a century, the organization said. \"Jody's achievement is something that we can celebrate as a proud moment for The Royal Mint. Capturing a portrait on the surface of a coin demands the utmost skill, and is one of the most challenging disciplines of the coin designer's art,\" chief executive Adam Lawrence said. \"This change of royal portrait will make 2015 a vintage year for UK coins, and it will be hugely exciting for us all to see the new design appear on the coins we use every day.\" Royal coinage portraits are usually updated every 15 to 20 years, the Royal Mint said.

In a series of stunts that should most certainly not be tried at home, Zhao Rui held a running electric drill to the side of his head without breaking the skin, bent an iron bar against a wall with his throat, and led on metal spears while breaking stones with his head. According to People's Daily Online, Zhao held the powerful drill against his temple for 10 seconds - but only left a small red mark where it had been. Headache: Zhao Rui holds a running power drill against his head for 10 seconds without injury . The display was intended to show how the 24-year-old had trained his body during his years of martial arts training - and his skills have made him a celebrity in his home city of Mianzhu in south-western China's Sichuan province. But the 24-year-old admitted that he has previously accidentally drilled a hole in his head when practising the stunt, ripping off a large piece of skin. He said: 'It was pretty painful but I got better and I learned from the experience and now I can practice pretty often without any problems.' And to prove the point he held a drill against his head for 10 seconds. Bending the rules: He also bends iron bars between his throat and a wall . Scoring points: His routine also involves lying on metal spikes while breaking stones over his head . Eyewitness Lian Tang, 25, said: 'It was incredible because after he removed it, there was no blood, only a bright red mark where the drill head had been.' The kung fu master started learning martial arts as a child after becoming fascinated with the discipline and at the age of 16 ran away to join a Shaolin Temple. He mainly wanted to learn Sanda (Chinese kick-boxing) and 'hard Qigong', which draws strength from the inner energy force known as qi.

But it seems it is now about to become a blessing, as baby hair is one of THE beauty trends for this summer. As championed by the likes of FKA Twigs, Katy Perry and Rihanna, the short fluff around the top of the forehead is becoming a key accessory. FKA Twigs regularly makes a feature of her baby hair . Katy Perry wore slicked down baby hair at the Givenchy show last month, while Rihanna is also a fan . The style is worn gelled down on the forehead, styled into curls and wavy tendrils.

For they burn far fewer calories watching TV on the sofa than their partners do. Doctors who measured how much energy three couples expended during day-to-day activities found large differences between the amounts men and women used. No time to relax: Women burn far fewer calories watching TV on the sofa than their partners do . All six ate a 600-calorie fry-up before each couple was assigned a different activity: an hour in the gym, three hours of cleaning, or lounging about. Their energy use was then assessed. Patrick and Roma Burn were lucky enough to spend the morning on the sofa. But while Patrick burned up 640 calories just by being a couch potato, Roma used only 292. The results are to be shown in a BBC1 programme, The Truth About Calories. Presenter Dr Chris van Tulleken said women tended to burn fewer calories at rest than men because they did not weigh as much and had less energy-hungry muscle mass. ‘Bigger people burn more calories than smaller ones,’ he said. But Patrick and Roma were extreme examples, he noted, as Mr Burn was ‘100kg of lean muscle’ and his wife ‘probably weighed half that’. A morning of light housework consumed just as many calories as one involving a strenuous workout, the programme found . The programme also found a morning of light housework consumed just as many calories as one involving a strenuous workout, which left the couple exhausted. Jim Norris got through 834 calories and his wife Elaine 729 during the morning, in which they spent an hour in the gym lifting weights. Meanwhile, Nick and Margaret Shenkin burnt 862 and 629 calories respectively cleaning the house.

He said: 'In early February we received a flurry of calls regarding a small bear like animal that was spotted in and around the Marlow area. 'It was eventually established it was actually a coatimundi that was on the loose after escaping from a home in the area. 'We soon discovered where he had escaped from and were in contact with the owners about getting him home safely. 'The coati seemed to be favouring three gardens by the river to visit for food so we laid a humane trap with pieces of fresh fruit at one of the properties. 'Thanks to the help of the nearby householders we were able to keep an eye on the trap and as soon as he was in there I was able to go down, collect him and return him to his owners. Caught: The coati escaped from its private owners after New Year and was finally captured in a humane trap . 'Considering he had been on the run for around two months he was in a very good condition and it was lovely to be able to reunite him with his owners.' Coatis, full name coatimundis and distant relatives to the raccoon, can be difficult to look after because their needs are so specialist. They are native to South, Central and parts of North America and are commonly found in tropical forests, living primarily on a diet of insects. The RSPCA has recommended that anyone considering getting one as a pet thoroughly researches the species.", "completion": "response:\n\nAnimal escaped from private owner in Buckinghamshire after New Year .\nRSPCA received calls from members of public who spotted a 'small bear'\nHe was caught in a humane trap last Monday and reunited with owners .\nCoatis are commonly found in tropical forests and live on diet of insects ."}

The women's-only liberal arts school in Massachusetts - which costs roughly $59,000 per year to attend - never explicitly banned transgender applicants. However, it said in a statement on its website Thursday that it felt compelled to clarify its policies 'in an era of a changing understanding of gender identity.' Wellesley College (the campus seen above) has revised its admissions policy to formally allow transgender students who identify as female . The college’s board of trustees approved the new policy on Wednesday night. Under the new guidelines, Wellesley College says it will consider for admission any applicant who 'lives as a woman and consistently identifies as a woman.' It adds that if gender identity is not 'clearly reflected' in application materials, the college will request additional information 'that may include a letter from a parent, healthcare provider, teacher, or clergy.' The updated code will come into effect in time for the next admission cycle for the Class of 2020. The move follows similar policy changes at all-women's colleges such as Mills College in California, Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, and Mount Holyoke and Simmons College, both in Massachusetts. Wellesley said it will not accept applications from transgender men, but would 'continue to support' any student who decides she no longer identifies as a woman during her education there. Wellesley, which was founded with the intention to prepare women for 'great conflicts' and 'vast reforms in social life' first opened its doors to students on September 8, 1875.

A burglar with a guilty conscience returned to a family's home to give them £400 in cash and apologise for breaking into their home while they slept, almost a year after the crime. Lee Bowen, 27, turned up at the house in Merthyr Tydfil in south Wales with a wad of bank notes to apologise for stealing mobile phones, a laptop and cash cards while they slept on New Year's Eve. But the astonished family decided his apology was not enough and reported him to police, with Bowen being promptly arrested. Jason Williams said the money was 'no compensation' for what Bowen had put his family through. The 'habitual criminal' had broken into the family home on New Year's Eve 2013 as they slept, Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard. But plagued by a guilty conscience, he returned to the house in November and said 'I burgled your house last year.. I'm very sorry. Here's £400.' The family reported him to police and Bowen was arrested the following day. He admitted everything to officer, even taking them to the street and pointing out the house he had targeted. The court heard Bowen has appeared in court 19 times for 45 offences including six previous house burglaries. Andrew Davies, defending, said: 'Although a habitual criminal he is trying to get his life on track. He is attempting to turn his life around.' A judge let Bowen walk free from Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court because he is trying to 'turn his life around'. Recorder Paul Hopkins QC told him: 'I am satisfied that the time is right to give you the opportunity to make a life for yourself.' Bowen offered the family £400 in cash by way of apology but they reported him to the police over the burglary . Bowen, of Merthyr Tydfil, was given a 12-month community order with supervision after he admitted burglary. He was warned that if he breached it he could be looking at at least four years in jail.

But this adorable little fruit bat wolfing down a banana is bound to change your perception. Filmed by Denise, a lady who rescues and cares for fruit bats, the video shows a much sweeter side of what is usually considered a rather spooky animal. Hungry fellow: The tiny fruit bat calms down completely when it spies a banana . The bat appears to pull hilarious facial expressions as it tucks into the fruit snack . Munching on the banana, the wide-eyed bat looks extremely excited as it fills its mouth before lifting its head back in satisfaction. Going in for another bite with even more enthusiasm, the bat opens its mouth as wide as it can and stuffs its face once more. Looking at the camera while it finishes its mouthful, the bat takes one last big bite of the banana and uses its pointed tongue to help shovel down the food. Before lifting its head one last time as if completely full and entirely satisfied. According to Storyful, an abundance of rainfall in Brisbane, Australia in recent weeks has resulted in food supplies becoming scarce - as a result, this bat was rescued by a lady called Nanette. At one point the bat is even seen poking its tongue out as it makes sure it has eaten every last morsel . Denise is among the people rescuing the bats from fruit netting during the poor weather. Referencing the video, Denise said the fruit bat was initially a little feisty until it spied the banana. After that he was happy once and began stuffing his face with the food – as is seen in the video. There's no need to be scared of these bats judging by the adorable rescue animal at Denise's shelter . Denise told MailOnline: 'Rain is good news for the coming winter but it's not such good news for hungry bat bellies. 'Although there is a magnificent array of native flowering occurring, rain washes the nectar and pollen out of the blossom and flying-foxes are forced to seek sustenance elsewhere. 'As a result we get an increased number of calls for bats trapped in large aperture fruit tree netting during and after rain events.' Denise added: 'Please net, grow and harvest sustainably. Never use any netting you can poke your finger through and use shadecloth or a similar weave to protect your fruit.

Automatic weapons are believed to have been used in the attack yesterday during the screening of a football match in Biskopsgarden, a suburb of Gothenburg with a history of gang violence. Detectives said it was too early to speculate on the motive behind the shooting - which happened at about 10.20pm local time (9.20pm GMT) - but there were indications that it was gang-related. Two dead and eight injured: The shooting took place inside a pub called ‘Var Krog och Bar’ (Our Tavern and Bar) in Biskopsgarden, a suburb of Gothenburg in Sweden, at about 10.20pm local time yesterday . Police spokesman Ulla Brehm said that at least two people were killed at the scene and several others taken to a hospital, adding: ‘There is absolutely nothing that indicates terrorism.’ One witness, who did not wish to be named, told Swedish broadcaster SVT that two men entered the pub and started shooting with automatic weapons. He said: ‘I didn't have a chance to think about what happened. Then I saw that my friend was bleeding. I tried to stop the bleeding as well as I could with my hand.’ Several people are now being questioned by police. Ms Brehm said the area on Hisingen, an island off Gothenburg, had seen a lot of gang violence and that was a likely explanation for the shooting. She added: ‘We have had a targeted police operation in this area because we have gang crime here. There have been shootings in the past.’ Location: Gothenburg  is in south-western Sweden and is the country's second biggest city (file picture) The attack took place inside a restaurant called ‘Var Krog och Bar’ (Our Tavern and Bar).

Ten ambulances were sent to the scene, and the injured are being treated at Sahlgrenska University Hospital - but a spokesman said last night: ‘We cannot say anything.’ Gun violence is not uncommon in Sweden's major cities, but shootings in public places with multiple victims are rare.

Lim, 60, went to North Korea on a humanitarian trip as he had done over a hundred times before, said Lisa Pak, a spokeswoman for his church, based in Mississauga, Ontario. On January 30, Lim traveled to North Korea from China with a companion from the church who last spoke with him the following day. Lim was scheduled to return February 4 from what was described as a \"routine\" trip to Rajin, in northeastern North Korea, where his church supports a nursery, orphanage and nursing home, according to the Light Korean Presbyterian Church. In 1986, Lim immigrated to Canada from South Korea with his wife and son. He speaks fluent Korean and leads a 3,000-member church. Pak, the church's spokeswoman, said she doesn't believe Lim would have engaged in any type of proselytizing, which is prohibited in North Korea. \"He knows the language, he knows the nature of the government, so we don't see that as a legitimate reason that he would be detained,\" she said. \"We don't believe that's the way he would have behaved. He's very wise about that.\" Previously, North Korea has detained Westerners on religious grounds.

But for the owner of a seven-year-old American pit bull terrier from Canada, the idea is less a wish and more a reality. The  clever dog, named Czr (pronounced Caesar), is something of an internet phenomenon and has accumulated more than 32,000 likes on its Facebook page for its ability to 'speak'. According to Czr’s Facebook page, the dog has been taught to communicate with classic learning theory . Its ability to say 'yes' and 'no' as well as nod and shake its head is what sets it apart from others like it. And its owner has captured a typical conversation  with the dog, who stands before her  in what appears to be a hallway. She asks her pet: ‘Do you want something?’ Immediately the dog looks at her, shakes its head and utters 'no'. Czr the American pit bull terrier listens attentively to its owner's questions and answers accordingly . She then asks the dog whether it is bored and he again replies, but this time with a nod and the word 'yes'. Working out that the dog wants to play, the owner rattles off a handful of options and the dog waits patiently until she guesses the right one. After asking the Czr if he plants to play with his sister, Via (short for Octavia), he answers with a nod. The conversation then begins to tail off with the woman asking a number of questions and the dog offering a bewildered look. The owner asks Czr whether he would like a treat, and immediately the dog answers with a nod and convincing 'yes'. No! Czr  shakes his head when his owner asks him whether he would like something . The video concludes with the dog 'shaking a paw' with its owner. According to Czr’s Facebook page, he has been taught to communicate with classic learning theory. The dog 'speaks' when he wants something and apparently he will reply to anyone.", "completion": "response:\n\nThe dog named Czr has more than 32,000 likes on its Facebook page .\nAccording to its owner the dog only 'speaks' when it wants something .\nThe seven-year-old American pit bull terrier lives in Canada ."}

One of the most talented edge rushers in the upcoming draft, Gregory starred for Nebraska at outside linebacker for the past two seasons. 'I blame myself,' Gregory told NFL media's Kimberly Jones from his Atlanta home. 'And I know it sounds cliche, but there's really no one else I can blame.' The 22-year-old found out about the failed test a fortnight ago on the phone to his father. He had asked him to open an envelope which he mistakenly believed to be an invitation to the draft in Chicago. Randy Gregory impressed at the combine, running the 40 in 4.64 secs with a 125 inch broad jump . Gregory had 17.5 sacks in his two years at Nebraska and is one of the most coveted linebackers in the draft . Many experts have the 22-year-old as a top-five pick. At 6ft 5in he is versatile enough to rush the quarterback or operate in coverage, but in a class loaded with pass rushers, he spoke of his concerns. 'Am I worried? Yeah, I'm worried,' he said. 'At the same time, I'm confident. I know I'm going to be all right in the end.' Gregory told Jones that he hasn't smoked marijuana since December, and that he did not use other recreational drugs. 'I don't wake up every day saying, I'd really love to go smoke,' he said. 'It's not a struggle for me every day (now), it really isn't. In the past, hell yeah, it's been a struggle. It really has been.' Gregory's issues with the drug were well-documented. He failed two drug tests in January and April in 2014 at Nebraska. 'I was worse at Nebraska than I've ever been at any other time of my life. But I know how I am now. I think if teams really look at how I am now more so than the past, they'll see I'm making strides to get better, as a person and as a player,' he said. Despite the red flags, 29 NFL teams spoke to Gregory at the combine and if they did not know of his off-field issues, Gregory made them aware during the interviews. Gregory will enter the NFL in the first stage of the league's substance abuse programme. 'This incident right now is a step toward ending my career. The last thing I want to do is fail another drug test and be out of the league.'", "completion": "response:\n\nGregory starred for Nebraska over the past two seasons and was selected by many experts as a top five pick .\nGregory, 22, failed two drug tests at Nebraska last year and failed a test at the combine last month .\nHe says he has not smoked the drug since December and promised to quit .\nHe will enter the NFL's substance abuse programme ."}

Rescuers found the toddler Saturday, hanging upside down in her mother's car, which had flipped into a frigid Utah river a day before. If the wreck occurred when police believe it did, she may have been there for as many as 14 hours. Lily's mother, Lynn Jennifer Groesbeck, died in the crash. She was 25 years old. How did her 18-month-old survive? One of the biggest factors was the car seat. Lily was in the proper car seat for her age and the seat appears to have been properly attached. Even though the child was trapped and upside down, her body remained in the seat and above the frigid water. Doctors say that such low temperatures are dangerous, but would be even more so if the baby were wet. Dry cold temperatures are more survivable than wet cold temperatures. Ironically, the cold might have actually helped Lily survive, said Dr. Barbara Walsh, with the University of Massachusetts Medical School. \"She's going to have a lower heart rate. She's going to have a lower metabolism. She's going to need less sugar,\" Walsh said. \"It's almost like the body is sort of knowing that it needs to shut down to protect itself.\" A variety of other factors were also likely at play. \"We don't know what time the child was last fed, when she drank. Given that it's wintertime and she was in her car seat, she was probably wearing mittens, a hat. We tend to over bundle our children, so the fact that she was dry, she probably had on multiple layers because it's winter, and there's always a chance that she had just been sort of fed right before this happened probably all played a role,\" Walsh said. A final factor may have been that the girl, as a toddler, has baby fat -- a little extra insulation. If she had been an infant, it might have been a different story. \"It's amazing. Children are very resilient, and I think sometimes we don't realize how much they actually can withstand,\" said Walsh.

More than half of the 2,000 people surveyed said they hoard books because they feel emotionally attached to them, with a third keeping books merely because they hate throwing anything away. Damaging: Fifty Shades of Grey was not a book people thought would impress guests, according to the survey . But 16 per cent admitted they keep certain titles on their shelves to make them look more intelligent. Those deemed most likely to impress guests included To Kill a Mockingbird, Moby-Dick and the Bible. However, Katie Price’s autobiography, Fifty Shades of Grey and anything by James Patterson topped the list of books readers thought would damage their reputation. Popular: Classics including To Kill a Mockingbird and Moby Dick were popular books used to impress guests . The survey, commissioned by storage firm Shurgard in advance of World Book Day tomorrow, found the average home contains 158 hardbacks and paperbacks. In total, it said Britain’s book collection could fill Wembley Stadium 16,000 times. The survey found that while sales of e-books are rising, traditional books still remain firm favourites. A third of those asked said they hoard books because they hate throwing anything away and 20 per cent keep their collection to pass on to children.

Jonny's brother Alistair missed the race because of a minor ankle injury but, with Olympic qualification to be decided in August and September at the test event in Rio and the world series Grand Final in Chicago, none of the leading triathletes will want to peak too soon. Alastair is hopeful of a return in time for the fourth round in Cape Town late next month. Browlee was visibly delighted with victory and said: 'In (the previous round in) Abu Dhabi I made many mistakes, and I've been beating myself up about it for the last few weeks.

UEFA took away £1million of television revenue owed to English clubs and fined the FA £42,000 two years ago for scheduling games that clashed with European ties. FA sources admit their hands are tied, but Clarke and Parkinson believe the situation devalues the FA’s own competition. ‘My question to the FA is why,’ said Clarke. ‘I know that people says it’s UEFA but the FA have to be stronger. I just find it strange that they don’t protect their own showpiece competition.’ Parkinson secured Bradford’s place in the FA semi-final draw for the first time in 104 years following a fiercely fought goalless draw, and he said: ‘I think it’s a little bit disrespectful to the FA Cup and the magnitude of this game coming up. ‘It’s a history-making game.

Woods, a former world No 1 whose ranking has plummeted to 96th, has played only twice on the 2014-15 PGA Tour and said he would not return until his game was 'tournament-ready'. Woods, the 14-time major winner, has struggled to find any form this year . 'As far as Augusta is concerned ... it's literally a 50-50 chance right now from what I can tell,' Begay, who played with Woods on the Stanford University golf team, told digital network 120 Sports on Wednesday. 'That's far better odds than what it was, say, three weeks ago. Three weeks ago, I would have said there was maybe a 1-in-10 chance of him playing at Augusta.' Woods has not competed since he withdrew from the Farmers Insurance Open early last month after 11 holes because of tightness in his back, and is still adapting to the fifth swing change of his career. Woods is currently on an indefinite break from the sport but aims to qualify for the 2016 Ryder Cup . He missed the Masters at Augusta last year for the first time in his career after being advised by doctors to have back surgery and his participation this year is in serious doubt given his struggle for form and fitness this season. The 14-time major champion posted the highest score of his professional career as he carded a mind-boggling 11-over-par 82 to miss the cut at the Phoenix Open in January, and many pundits believe he is suffering from the chipping 'yips'. However, Begay, a television analyst with Golf Channel, believes Woods is now settling into his new swing under the supervision of consultant Chris Como. Tiger Woods struggled for form during the Waste Management Phoenix Open back in January . 'It was good for him to take a step back, to reassess a variety of different things and do things on his timeline,' said Begay, a 42-year-old Native American golfer who won four times on the PGA Tour. 'My suggestion to him was to take as much time as he needed to just figure out this issue with his short game and also to work on or clean up a couple of things that might be a little loose with his golf swing. 'Any transition, any change that you are making mechanically, takes a little time to settle, so that's what he's done. We've had some good discussions over the last week or so and he feels good about it.'", "completion": "response:\n\nInjury-hit Tiger Woods has played only twice on the 2014-15 PGA Tour .\nWoods withdrew from the Farmers Insurance Open early last month .\nFormer world No 1 has seen his ranking plummet to 96th ."}

Pictured: Film The Fault In Our Stars . It has long been a mystery to men why so many women enjoy watching tear jerker movies with their friends. But now scientists have come up with a suggestion – sharing sad emotions helps women bond. A research team at Cardiff University found that by sharing their emotions women found the happy parts of films more joyful and the sad bits less sad. Job van der Schalk, a psychologist at Cardiff University, said: ‘Our findings suggest that a negative emotional experience such as watching a ‘weepy’ is more positive when it is shared with a friend. ‘And, at the same time, a positive emotional experience, such as watching a ‘romcom’, should equally be more pleasant when shared.’ The study involved 30 pairs of female friends aged between 20 and 33 who were shown emotionally powerful images and asked to rate them on a scale from ‘very negative’ to ‘very positive’. The scientists put one of each pair in a brain scanner to monitor their reactions, and the volunteers were also asked to view and rate the images while on their own and also while together. The researchers found the images were seen more positively when the pairs were together, The Sunday Times reported. The study, published in the journal Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, said: ‘When people go to the cinema to watch a film, they ... anticipate a positive subjective impact of sharing this emotional experience.’ And Hollywood success seems to back the theory. The 2008 film Marley and Me, which surrounds a couple’s relationship with their dog, took £160m at the global box office, and last year’s film The Fault in Our Stars - about two teenage cancer patients who find love - took more than £200m. Aggie Romeril, 22, a London beauty manager, said: ‘I think we’re a “stream it and weep” age. You scroll through Netflix, find who’s got the biggest laptop and bundle into a housemate’s bed for a sob session.’ Marley and Me, which surrounds a couple’s relationship with their dog, took £160m at the global box office.

'I said to him after the Newcastle game I have a long memory and I know how good he was at Wigan, what he possesses, and how scared managers are when he is flying,' said Sherwood. 'He can be anything he wants to be – I really mean that. I told him he needs to be a little bit fitter and needs to do a little bit extra than the other players and he said, 'No problem'.

Flam, a cat in Nashville, Tennessee, may well be the first of its kind to have had a conversation with a human being. But sadly, as documented on video, the little chat didn't go down that well with the feline. In the clip is Penny Adams, a professional photographer who volunteers her time at the Cat Shoppe Rescue centre. Sitting on the floor, she announces to the camera that she is holding a cat-to-human language translator on her phone. Penny, who doesn't herself know what it is being translated by the app, activates the meowing sound and immediately Flam, who sits underneath a table, becomes noticeably intrigued. Penny announces to the camera that she is about to use a cat-to-human translator app on her phone . Jumping up, the feline negotiates a number of dumbbells on the floor before making its way towards Penny. With its tail poised, the cat maintains its eye-contact while lifting its paw and climbing up onto her leg. Suddenly it lashes out at her – opening its mouth to bare its teeth it strikes her with its paw. Intrigued, the cat approaches Penny with its tail poised and begins slowly climbing up her leg . Reacting by blocking the cat with her arm, Penny laughs in surprise as the insulted feline continues to bare its teeth before scuttling off. According to Penny, she had visited Kate Framke's home – Flam’s owner – to photograph her other cat  Waffles for a fundraising calendar for The Cat Shoppe. After struggling to get Waffles’ attention with toys and treats, Penny used her human-to-cat translator app as a way of getting the cat to look at the camera. The cat, clearly insulted by what the human-to-cat translator app is saying, attacks Penny with its paw . Penny said: ‘It worked, but it also got an unusual reaction from Flam, who proceeded to walk up slowly and pop me in the head. We laughed so hard.’ She added: ‘Who knows what the app was really saying in cat voice, but he sure didn't like it.’ The Cat Shoppe is Nashville’s first feline-friendly shop that sells a number of cat-related products and also runs a non-profit cat rescue centre.

The men were having dinner on Friday night in the western city of Wakayama when they ate puffer fish liver, which prompted vomiting and breathing difficulties early the next morning. Puffer fish - also called blowfish or fugu in Japanese - are the world's most toxic group of fish and their livers, ovaries and skin contain tetrodotoxin, 100 times more lethal than cyanide. Dicing with death: Five Japanese men were poisoned after eating banned parts of the puffer fish (file photo) Yet eating the fish's flesh is a tradition in Japan, where wealthy diners play the Russian roulette of the restaurant world by dining on sashimi slivers so thin they are almost transparent. According to a city health official, the men asked to eat a banned, toxic part of the fish - which the most foolhardy fugu aficionados are said to enjoy for the tingling it produces on the lips. Popular: The tradition of eating thin slices of 'fugu' persists despite dozens of poisonings a year . The tingling is only the first symptom of tetrodotoxin poisoning, and is seen as part of the thrill for lovers of the fish. But if the toxin is served in any significant quantity it then paralyses the muscles, suffocating victims as it reaches their chests and diaphragms while they are still conscious. The health official said the men were in their 40s and 50s and the restaurant was shut down for five days from yesterday amid an investigation. 'They consumed a dinner that included liver, which is regarded as toxic material,' she told AFP, reading from a statement. Calls to the restaurant went unanswered. Chefs who want to serve puffer fish must train for two years before taking a rigorous test which a third of applicants fail. The most prized species is the tiger puffer, takifugu rubripes, whose flesh is safe to eat but whose liver, ovaries and intestine can all kill. It is not clear which species of puffer fish the men ate. Puffer fish account for the majority of Japan's food poisoning deaths but the delicacy shows no sign of dying out, although it is heavily regulated.

There is no government task more basic than keeping citizens safe. And yet Republicans are recklessly putting our national security at risk to protect their own political security. By failing to do a full extension of DHS funding — holding it hostage with demands that the legislation roll back the President's immigration actions -- Republicans are leaving uncertain the livelihoods of more than 240,000 men and women who proudly serve as employees of the Border Patrol, Transportation Security Administration and other DHS agencies. Local law enforcement will continue to be denied access to the grants that help them keep our streets safe. The Federal Emergency Management Agency and other agencies that respond to natural disasters, like major winter storms, would have their operations disrupted.

The Republican Congress seems more intent on bickering with itself, pushing an agenda to help special interests and catering to the most extreme wing of the party, than working for the middle class.

A French marketing campaign by Nutella has backfired after banning the word 'lesbian' (file picture) The Nutella website says: 'Here you can create your custom messages and share them with those you love.' But users realised that there is a long list of words banned, which bizarrely does not allow 'lesbian' but permits the word 'gay'. The word 'Christian' can also be written on the jars, but other religious terms such as 'Jewish' and 'Muslim' have been banned by Nutella, Pink News reported. The 'Say it with Nutella' campaign allowed customers to have a name or message written on a jar of the chocolate spread . Health-related terms, presumably in case any one tried to blame the hazelnut spread on obesity, have also been banned, including the words 'cancer' and 'diabetes'. The company, owned by Ferrero, has also outlawed words which could be used to highlight their controversial ingredient palm oil, the farming of which allegedly destroys the habitats of orangutans.

Timothy Robenhorst, from Green Bay, Wisconsin, was shocked to find out his son Kayden had been mistreating a classmate, and in response gave him a tough workout, gardening duty and instructions to apologize. For the physically grueling stages of his 5-part punishment, Kayden was dragged out of bed at 4:30am and made to do 50 push-ups on his fists. Spelling it out: Timothy Robenhorst was shocked to heard his son, Kayden, had been bullying somebody at school - so devised the above punishment for him . Next, the boy was tasked with performing ten tougher, incline push-ups, then running a mile. Early-morning Wisconsin temperatures are still routinely below freezing. But Kayden's labors were not over after his hellish morning workout - and the boy is stuck doing landscaping work at two houses his father apparently owns for an unspecified length of time. Punished: Kayden, pictured, was given an array of unpleasant tasks to make up for his wrongs . But the punishment also has an emotional and social aspect - with Kayden also being instructed to apologize to his victim in front of his entire class the day after, which was set to happen Wednesday. Robenhorst then posed for a photograph with his son and a poster spelling out his punishment, and encouraged people to share it. As of Friday night it had been shared more than 1,000 times.

The court said the sentence could be served on weekends, and Kraun confirmed Monday that McGill already spent two weekends behind bars. After news of McGill's punishment went viral, the solicitor's office announced Monday that prosecutors would amend his sentence, saying in a statement, \"The actions of the court with regards to Mr. McGill's sentence for violating the city's noise laws was disproportionate to a first-time offense.\" \"As such, the court has amended its sentence to time served and further probation (is) suspended,\" the statement said. Chief prosecutor Bill Riley told WSB that the jail sentence was his idea because, he said, \"fines don't seem to work.\" \"The only thing that seems to stop the activity is actually going to jail,\" McGill said. Still, McGill said being locked up with \"real criminals\" was hard, and so was being away from his family. \"I just want this to be over with,\" he told WSB before getting word of the \"time served\" adjustment. \"I'm away from my family, my wife, and she's got to take care of the two little boys and I have four dogs.\"", "completion": "response:\n\nKevin McGill was initially ordered to serve 30 days in jail for picking up trash too early in the morning .\nMcGill already began his sentence, doing two weekends behind bars .\nCity relents, letting him off with \"time served\" after story goes viral ."}

The problem is, when you’re confined to a little seat on a fighter jet hurtling through the clouds at the speed of sound and the pilot is holding a chocolate bar, just how can you get your hands on it? Well a pilot and his navigator found the perfect way without having to take their eyes off the sky, and captured the moment on camera. The pilots appear to be part of the US Navy, judging by their helmets, but little is known about the origin of the video. The pilot lets go of the chocolate bar to allow the gravitational pull to transport it to his navigator . Holding a Snickers chocolate bar in his hand, the pilot lets go and allows the gravitational force to do the rest. Waiting with an outstretched arm, as the chocolate bar floats behind the pilot, the navigator reaches out and after a little bit of scrabbling manages to catch it in his hands. Throwing it back up in the air before catching it again the navigator waves the bar around in celebration and the pilot gives him the thumbs up in approval. Floating in the air, the chocolate begins its journey towards the navigator who waits with an outstretched hand . On its way: The navigator scrambles for the chocolate bar as it floats towards him and manages to catch it . The fact that it was uploaded to an empty Youtube account however has brought about speculation that the video is a commercial for Snickers. But it may just be a way for the two pilots to keep their identity a mystery while having some fun. Weightlessnes like this occurs when there are no external objects touching the chocolate bar and exerting a push or pull upon it. When in a state of free fall like the pilots, the only force acting upon the snack is gravity – a non-contact force. And since gravity cannot be felt without any other opposing forces, there is no sensation of it present. Success: After catching the chocolate bar the navigator celebrates and the pilot gives him the thumbs up .", "completion": "response:\n\nThe Snickers bar is released by the pilot and floats behind him .\nScrabbling in the air the navigator catches it in his hand .\nPilot gives him the thumbs up as a seal of approval .\nBelieved to be US Navy pilots judging by their helmets ."}

Robert Stephens was found drunkenly staggering around a petrol station having bought a gallon of unleaded fuel less than eight hours after being released from prison for a string of offences. The 23-year-old, who is addicted to drinking and sniffing gasoline, was first handed an ASBO banning him from large swathes of his home city following a bizarre drunken outburst during which he taunted unsuspecting women with sexual jibes.

He was also issued with an ASBO banning him from drinking petrol after investigators noted the connection between the habit and his offences. In court, one official said: 'Stephens is known to drink and sniff petrol and during his spree of offences it was noted by some witnesses that he smelled strongly of petrol. 'His presence within the exclusion area coupled with his intoxication and purchase of petrol represents a significantly high risk of serious offences being committed.

He did it all publicly,\" before asking, \"How did you find out that he had a baby by another woman?\" Brown has been the subject of rumors that he fathered a daughter with another woman while in a relationship with Tran. He has neither confirmed nor denied the stories, but the story heated up when Tran tweeted on March 4, \"Listen. One can only take so much. The best of luck to Chris and his family. No baby drama for me.\" The tweet was later deleted. Brown and Tran have had an on-again, off-again relationship for years. In 2012, Brown posted a video on Twitter questioning whether it was possible to be in love with two people. At the time, the singer had broken up with Tran after once again growing close to singer Rihanna, whom he assaulted while they were dating in 2009. \"I love Karrueche very much but I don't want to see her hurt over my friendship with Rihanna,\" Brown said in the video. \"I'd rather be single allowing us to both be happy in our lives.\" Brown and Rihanna eventually reunited but then broke up again, and he and Tran, who bills herself as a model and entrepreneur, resumed seeing each other. On Wednesday, Brown commented from his Instagram account on a racy photo Tran posted of herself in a swimsuit while on vacation. The singer advised her to \"Continue to be a lady beautiful.\" Vanzant's interview with Tran airs at 8 p.m. ET March 28.", "completion": "response:\n\nTran and Brown have had an on-again, off again relationship .\nThey broke it off recently amid reports that he fathered child with another woman .\nHe once publicly proclaimed being in love with both her and Rihanna ."}

Nick Clegg yesterday handed over £150,000 of public money to promote a language barely anyone speaks. The Lib Dem leader’s generosity to the handful of Cornish speakers is the latest in a series of extraordinary gestures to the county over recent months. Yesterday’s handout brings Coalition spending on attempts to revive Cornish to £500,000 – enough to give nearly £900 to every person who speaks it. The Deputy Prime Minister’s interest in Cornish provoked cynicism among opponents, who pointed to his party’s lowly status in the polls. It comes a week after the party announced a drop in fuel prices that mainly benefits areas full of Lib Dem voters. The 5p cut on fuel duty covers 17 rural areas, 14 of which are Lib Dem seats. Three of Cornwall’s six MPs are Lib Dems with slim majorities and Mr Clegg even chose to visit the county rather than attend the Commons on the day Chancellor George Osborne presented his Autumn Statement in December. Mr Clegg said: ‘I am determined to keep [Cornish] alive and thriving. ‘Great efforts have been made to revive and return Cornish to common use. It would be a crime to let such a distinct language disappear again.’ Cornish has not been widely used since the 18th century. At the 2011 census 557 people listed it as their first language. Last April, Lib Dems persuaded the Council of Europe to recognise Cornish people as a ‘national minority’ in England, which means the Government is now pledged to ‘combat discrimination’ against them. Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said: ‘I don’t know what the Cornish is for a blatant electoral bribe, but with £150,000 of taxpayers’ money I’m sure that Nick Clegg can tell us. It would appear that Mr Clegg is trying to buy votes with public money.’ The money will go to the Cornish Language Partnership, an organisation financed by taxpayers and run by activists and local council nominees. Mr Clegg said yesterday he will stay on as a caretaker deputy prime minister if there is a hung parliament because the country will need a government in place to ‘keep the lights on’. He confirmed he was prepared to stay on while coalition talks are hammered out, which could take weeks or months.", "completion": "response:\n\nLiberal Democrat leader’s generosity to handful of Cornish speakers is latest in series of extraordinary gestures to county over recent months .\nHandout brings Coalition spending aimed at reviving Cornish to £500,000 .\nDeputy Prime Minister’s interest in Cornish provoked cynicism among opponents, who pointed to his party’s lowly status in the polls ."}

Authorities say Leigh, 41, collected almost $40,000 from One Fund and other sources after claiming to have suffered a brain injury during the attack. They say she received $8,000 payment from One Fund Boston, which was set up to compensate bombing victims. She's also accused of receiving $1,700 from a school fundraiser, collecting more than $9,000 in contributions from an online fundraiser and getting more than $18,000 in benefits from the Massachusetts Victims for Violent Crime compensation fund. The indictment says she also accepted free medical treatment. No one is contesting that Leigh was at the marathon on April 15, 2013, the day of the attack. But Boston Police and Suffolk County investigators say she wasn't hurt. She apparently did not claim any injury or seek any medical treatment until about two weeks later. \"When she did begin to make those claims, she billed herself as a 'hero' who ran toward the second blast,\" authorities said.

A former soldier who battered a seven-month-old baby so badly that its eyes rolled to the back of its head has been jailed. Paul Davies, 28, left the infant with life-changing injuries and then falsely claimed to the child's mother that it had suffered a seizure. The woman said she had trusted Davies to look after the seven-month-old and when she returned he claimed the baby had 'gone rigid' after having some milk and vomiting. Prosecuting, Tara Wolfe said: 'He said he started to become panicky. He said he tried to call 999 but his phone wasn't working.' The baby was 'pale and stiff' when paramedics arrived and rushed it to hospital where scans found bruising around the neck, a brain bleed and bleeding to both retinas. Experts told the court the brain injuries were most probably due to shaking, and that the full effects of the trauma may not be known for years. The victim's mother, who is also not being identified, told the court she had 'trusted' Davis with the baby. Davis, of Clevedon, Somerset, initially denied injuring the tot and implied it could have been forcefully treated by its mother or paramedics. But he pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm to the infant and was jailed for a 20 months at Bristol Crown Court. Judge Michael Roach told him: 'We will never know precisely how the baby came by its injuries. 'Whether through temper or loss of control, you caused devastating injuries to that small child.' Defending, Fiona Elder said: 'It was a one-off incident and a momentary loss of control.' She said Davis had been using his former partner's phone and the day before the incident she had cancelled her contract and left him unable to call 999. The court heard Davis was medically discharged from the Army and was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.

With their pink woolly noses and whistling speech, the Clangers were among the most memorable children’s TV characters of the 1970s. And fans will be relieved to see they have not changed much as they return to our screens. Last night, the BBC gave viewers the first glimpse of the Clangers, which have been reinvented for a £5million series due to be broadcast in spring. The Clanger family – Major, Mother, Small, Tiny and Granny – are still knitted from wool and look similar to the original series’ characters. They also still live together on the moon in the new series, which will be narrated by actor and presenter Michael Palin. Advances in animation since The Clangers first aired more than 45 years ago will mean some slight differences. ‘We are able to give them more personality – a little twitch of the ear which can say so much,’ said Jackie Edwards, the series’ executive producer. ‘But she added: ‘The new series is very faithful to the original. It is still made with wool and love… there is a magic about The Clangers that’s enduring. You can tell what they’re saying.’ Fans of The Clangers were immediately taken with the teaser, declaring the creatures just as ‘adorable’ as the originals. ‘My four-year old was entrances,’ said one viewer on Twitter. ‘Now this takes me back!’ said another. The original series of The Clangers aired in 1969, and ran for 26 episodes until November 1972. There was also a four-minute election special broadcast in 1974. The £5million new series will be narrated by actor, presenter and comedian Michael Palin, pictured . Last night’s episode explained to children what a solar eclipse is, ahead of the eclipse expected to take place this morning. It stressed that viewers should take care of their sight, only viewing the phenomenon through special goggles. The series has had heavy involvement from Daniel Postgate, the son of Oliver Postgate, who co-created and narrated the original version of The Clangers.", "completion": "response:\n\nMemorable 1970s show has been reinvented for a £5million spring series .\nThe Clangers remake will be narrated by actor and presenter Michael Palin .\nLast night’s episode explained to children what a solar eclipse is ."}

Firemen refused to risk their safety by rescuing a cat that had been stuck in a tree for six days – so two young men stepped in to save the day. The pair climbed about 50ft to bring down Spot from a leylandii in Stroud, Gloucestershire, after firefighters said the branches were too thin to support their weight. Several attempts were made to lure her down and the fire service visited the scene twice, after the RSPCA was called. Gloucestershire’s deputy chief fire officer, Andy Hermiston, said: 'This is the second time we were called out because a cat was stuck 50ft up a tree. The first time, a month ago, the cat managed to get down itself. 'On both occasions, we quickly discovered that the branches at the top of the tree where the cat was stuck were too thin to support the weight of a firefighter. 'While rescuing animals is an important part of our work, it cannot be at the risk of our firefighter's safety. 'Although the service cannot condone members of the public putting themselves at risk we're pleased the cat has been safely returned to its owner and that the young people involved were not injured whilst carrying out the rescue. 'However, we must also be mindful of the fact that the rescuers may have put themselves at serious risk and, as we have seen in the past, would-be rescuers can become victims, sometimes with tragic consequences.' Spot's owner Sarah Mills was relieved and eager to thank the rescuers, who climbed the adjacent trees with torches at around 8pm, and plucked the tortoiseshell to safety. 'I would like to thank them, I don't know who they are,' she said, adding that she will be keeping Spot indoors and will take her to a vet for a check-up.

In a highly critical report, the Commons international development committee says ministers wrote out huge cheques to a series of major aid agencies like the World Bank as they scrambled to meet David Cameron’s controversial target to spend billions more on aid. But although the money has been promised, and counts towards meeting the UK’s aid target, much of it will not be spent for years. Disaster: Villagers clean up their destroyed homes after it was hit by Cyclone Pam on Tanna Island in Vanuatu last week . Today’s report estimates that at least £2.1 billion of ‘aid’ money is currently sitting in the bank unspent. It warns that ministers have become ‘increasingly reliant’ on multilateral organisations like the World Bank as they try to get billions more pounds of aid money out of the door. This type of spending was increased by 43 per cent over the previous year as the department rushed to hit Mr Cameron’s target of spending 0.7 per cent of Britain’s income on aid. Targets: David Cameron has a target of spending 0.7% of Britain's income on aid . In a further criticism of the aid target, MPs say it distorts spending towards the end of the year – meaning that victims of natural disasters in the autumn are much more likely to get aid from Britain than those who are hit by catastrophe in the spring. The Department for International Development (Dfid) gave £6.3 billion to so-called multilateral aid agencies in 2013 – roughly 63 per cent of its budget. Today’s report says MPs are ‘concerned by Dfid’s extensive use of multilateral organisations to achieve this growth (in spending). Due to the way this is accounted for, some of this money will not be spent for a number of years.’ A Dfid spokesman last night defended the department’s spending. The spokesman said: ‘We fund multilaterals when they are the best partners to work with us to deliver our objectives, whether that be in a humanitarian crisis, natural disaster or on a specific topic such as migration and refugees. ‘We are living in a world that is facing unprecedented humanitarian pressures. The UK is proud to be a world leader in responding to emergencies.’", "completion": "response:\n\nReport estimates £2.1billion of aid sitting in the bank .\nMinisters increasingly reliant on organisations like World Bank .\nNatural disaster victims more likely to get aid in autumn than in spring ."}

Ministers say allowing online shoppers to pick up their purchases at local shops, rather than have them delivered at home, will give a boost to the high street. Retailers will no longer have to apply for planning permission – which costs £195 per application– and fill in reams of paperwork before being allowed to offer the service from April 15. Online boost: All shops in the UK will be allowed to offer ‘click and collect’ services for people to collect their parcels from next month . The UK is the biggest user of ‘click and collect’ services in the world - and use is expected to double in the next three years. But planning minister Brandon Lewis said high streets do not have to lose out, because online shopping can bring people into town centres. Many people who are at work all day - and know they will miss the postman – can choose to have parcels delivered to their local shop where they can collect them at a convenient time. Mr Lewis said: ‘Far from threatening the high street, online shopping offers a new opportunity. How we shop is changing radically and I want to help our high streets thrive from online competition. Ministers say allowing online shoppers to collect at local shops will give a boost to the high street . ‘These measures will mean even more retailers can offer ‘click and collect’ services, encouraging shoppers to visit their businesses and pick up their purchases at a time that suits them.’ There was a boom in Christmas shopping via click and collect this year – with John Lewis saying half its customers picked up parcels in store rather than having them posted to their homes in December. Supermarkets and department stores are already using the service, and some allow ebay and Amazon customers to pick up their purchases instore.

Get me Out of Here. The former England all-rounder took part in a 'Tuker Trial' on Tuesday, and completed it by eating a cockroach with such nonchalance that the show's presenter ended up vomiting. Scroll down for video . Former England cricketer Freddie Flintoff devoured a large, brown Madagascar hissing cockroach . Flintoff's hair resembled that of Keith Flint from the Prodigy (right) during the trial . Host Dr Chris Brown lost his lunch as he watched former England cricketer Freddie Flintoff devour a large, brown, Madagascar hissing cockroach. The cheeky ex-cricketer was given the task of devouring seven courses of critters, and as Chris watched on he couldn't hide his unease. Putting his good table etiquette on show, the 37-year-old picked up the at least two inch long insect on chopsticks and tried to psych himself up about eating it. 'I'm going to do it and I'm going to crunch it and enjoy it,' he said to himself before he chomped down hard. Flintoff happily chewed the live cockroach, before expressing his disgust at the taste of the insect . Flintoff's meal caused the show's host Dr Chris Brown to lose his lunch . The crunch was heard echoing throughout the jungle, while Freddie sat back on his chair like he'd just bit down on a T-bone steak at a Michelin star restaurant. But it wasn't long before he acknowledged the true extent of the disgusting encounter. 'Oh the back end! Jesus... It's horrible!' Freddie roared. Showing of his veterinary skills, Chris, 36, knew exactly why Freddie was having such an issue with 'the back end'. 'That's a female... The white stuff inside your mouth is the egg sack of the cockroach... It's her eggs,' Dr Chris told him as he held one hand over his mouth and clutched his stomach. Unable to handle watching Freddie crunch down on the critters, Chris keeled over and started dry retching. He then had to walk away from the challenge to vomit in the bushes. 'Oh the back end! Jesus... It's horrible!' Freddie roared as he showed his competitive streak .

'I just thought, \"What year am I living in here? Women can't control themselves when they drink during this movie?\" I don't know what the message was.' Meanwhile, Michael Deeds who reported the ban for the Idaho Statesman, said it's just another example of 'nonsensical' regulation. 'Here's an equally polite if totally exasperated message right back at state lawmakers: Idaho's prudish, remarkably bad alcohol statute needs to be tied up, blindfolded and dominated by someone with a brain,' he wrote. Explicit content: According to the Idaho Statesman , state law prohibits the sale of booze when it comes to 'sexually explicit films' Dave Corkill, a theater owner in Idaho, agrees that the law is flawed.

A couple from Brookfield, Wisconsin, has been accused of locking their autistic 13-year-old daughter in the basement of this house, forcing her to wear a diaper and sending her to school covered in feces . Police were alerted when an anonymous caller said the youngster was 'being treated like an animal'. Prosecutors say the child has low-level autism and some cognitive disabilities, and was forced into the basement every day after school. There she would be made  to put on an adult onesie and a pull-up diaper,Fox 6 reported. In the morning she would then get on the school bus. The girl's mother and stepfather, who have not been identified, are charged with child neglect. When police removed the girl from their home in Brookfield, just west of Milwaukee, the temperature in her basement bedroom was around 50 degrees.

The first novice to win the feature race of the Festival since Captain Christy in 1974 was on Saturday feted as friends and well-wishers gathered at the Oxfordshire stable of trainer Mark Bradstock and wife Sara in the village of Letcombe Bassett, which once housed five-time Gold Cup hero Golden Miller. Friday’s victory for a small stable of 10 horses was a heart-warming end to a Festival dominated by the big guns from Britain and Ireland. 2015 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Coneygree could race at Newbury on November 28 . Nico de Boinville kisses the Cheltenham Gold Cup following Coneygree's length and a half victory . The eight-year-old, who was ridden by conditional jockey Nico de Boinville, will not run again this season and Sara Bradstock, daughter of the late amateur rider, broadcaster and journalist, Lord Oaksey, believes Coneygree’s similarity to Denman means a crack at the Newbury race on November 28 is feasible challenge. Coneygree won the Denman Chase at the track last month on his final prep race for the Gold Cup. His family also have history in the race, with older brother Carruthers winning the 2011 Hennessy. Sara said: ‘We might consider the Betfair Chase and the King George, for sure. The world is our oyster now but, depending on what the handicapper does, we might try to win the Hennessy off top weight. ‘We know he likes Newbury and he seems to have a lot of similarities with Denman.’ De Boinville (left) and trainer Mark Bradstock are all smiles with the 2015 Gold Cup trophy . The Paul Nicholls-trained Denman, the 2008 Gold Cup winner, won the Hennessy twice in 2007 and 2009. On the latter occasion, he defied a BHA handicap mark of 174 when carrying 11st 12lb. Chief handicapper Phil Smith intends rating Coneygree 171, the highest for a novice this century and 1lb higher than given to Willie Mullins’ Vautour after his spectacular JLT Novices’ Chase win. Meanwhile, hopes of a family double within 24 hours were dashed when heavy ground at Uttoxeter prompted Carruthers to be withdrawn from the Midlands National, which was won by Irish raider Goonyella.

The group of 11 people includes seven Britons, an American, a Canadian and two Sudanese, Mehmet Ali Ediboglu said. Ediboglu, an opposition Turkish lawmaker, told The Observer that he had spoken with the students' families, who were convinced their loved ones wanted to work for ISIS and were asking him for help tracking them down in neighboring Syria. \"They have been cheated, brainwashed. That is what I, and their relatives, think,\" Ediboglu said, according to the newspaper.

In an interview published Monday in Turkey's Hürriyet Daily News, the group of parents said they were worried and vowed not to leave Turkey without their children.

The rally, called \"Israel Wants Change,\" was put on by One Million Hands, a grassroots movement that focuses its efforts on two major issues: a two-state solution and a reduction in the cost of living. On both of these topics, founder Dror Ben-Ami says, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has failed. \"We think that the only way to go forward on that account is to change government and to get this current government out of office. To get Bibi out of office,\" says Ben-Ami. Organizers are not promoting any specific candidate or pushing voters toward any political party in the March 17 balloting. Instead, they are encouraging voters to change the current administration. Police estimated the crowd at 40,000 people. Headlining the rally was Meir Dagan, the former head of Mossad, Israel's spy agency, and a vocal critic of Netanyahu. In recent weeks, Dagan criticized Netanyahu's decision to speak before the U.S. Congress, and he continued his criticism at the rally, saying that he has never seen such stagnation in Israeli politics. Netanyahu still has broad support in Israel, and his Likud party is doing well in the polls. The Zionist Union is Likud's primary challenger. In the initial round of polling immediately following Netanyahu's speech before Congress, the Zionist Union was expected to win 24 seats in the Knesset while Likud was expected to win 23 seats. The poll comes from CNN affiliate Channel 2 Israel. Because of the nature of Israeli politics, Netanyahu's Likud party could lose the election while Netanyahu still becomes prime minister. In many ways, this rally was reminiscent of a similar social movement that began in the summer of 2011. Hundreds of thousands of protesters packed the streets of Tel Aviv, demanding improvements in the cost of housing, education, and health care. What started as a small social media campaign turned into a nationwide movement that spread to other major cities. This time, the issues are different. But the growing sense of discontent and the calls for change remain.", "completion": "response:\n\nGroup One Million Hands sponsors event in Tel Aviv .\nThey want to see a new prime minister .\nIsraeli elections come March 17 ."}

A man who tied a cockerel to a trap and used it as live bait to lure foxes has been convicted of cruelty.

He appeared in court in Birmingham to face charges against the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981 and the Animal Cruelty Act 2006.

'The bird was horrifyingly dehydrated, emaciated and bruised all the way down to its skin from being tied up with nylon bailing twine for some days. 'I was just sickened to see the cockerel stuck desperately in a barbaric situation like this - completely vulnerable, defenceless, and in alien surroundings, just lying there waiting to die either slowly from dehydration or by being eaten by the fox that this trap was clearly set for.' Nicholas Wells, 37, of Bedworth, had pleaded not guilty, blaming a burglar for the offence - which was discovered by an RSPCA inspector last June - but was found guilty after an eight-hour trial in Birmingham . Wells admitted owning the trap but said that normally he would use eggs, cat food and dead chickens to catch foxes roaming around the area. He claimed that a burglar had brought the bantam cockerel and had placed it in the trap - but his argument was thrown out by the district judge. The court was told that the cockerel 'was very lucky to have pulled through from a terrible act of cruelty.' The bird had survived the ordeal and, according to the RSPCA inspector, 'is now living the happy, healthy life that he deserves.' Wells was found guilty of using a live bird as a decoy for the purpose of killing or taking a wild animal and causing unnecessary suffering to ananimal.

The Northern Ireland international left Ibrox fans incensed in the summer of 2012 when he walked out post-liquidation to join Swiss side Sion on a free transfer. But, as he prepares to play in Glasgow for the first time in almost three years in Wednesday night’s international friendly at Hampden, the 27-year-old revealed he has unfinished business at Rangers. Kyle Lafferty said he is disappointed with how his time at Rangers ended in the summer of 2012 . Lafferty admitted that he would like to return to Rangers to improve fans perceptions of him . Lafferty is set to play in Glasgow for the first time since his exit for Northern Ireland on Wednesday . ‘Some Rangers fans have asked me if I’d go back there - and I’d jump at the chance,’ admitted Lafferty, who is under contract at Norwich until the summer of 2017 but currently on loan at Turkish side Rizespor. ‘But whether that’s an option or not is another thing.’ Lafferty won three SPL titles and both League and Scottish Cups during his controversial spell at the Govan club between 2008 and 2012. However, he saw his attitude and commitment regularly questioned amid a series of on and off-field mishaps, including high-profile bust-ups with both Neil Lennon and Ally McCoist. Lafferty was one of a number of leading players – including Steven Naismith and captain Steve Davis – who were branded mercenaries by then-chief executive Charles Green after exercising their right to refuse to transfer their registrations over to newco Rangers. Lafferty is part of the Northern Ireland side who will face Scotland in a friendly on Wednesday at Hampden . Lafferty hopes that he will one day have an opportunity to return to Glasgow to play club football . ‘What happened for me at Rangers was disappointing,’ he continued. ‘The way it happened (leaving on a free after liquidation) wasn’t how I wanted to end my career there - but it had to be done. ‘But I’ve supported Rangers since I was a young boy and I still support them now.

But Burnley would receive about £6million in compensation if Ings joined another club in England, while a move abroad would net the second-bottom  side just £300,000. It would cost £43m for United to make Radamel Falcao's season-long loan from Monaco permanent, and Ings is a cut-price option. The starlet was reluctant to leave Burnley in January but becomes a free agent after May. Manchester City contacted his representatives in February and want to sign Ings to boost their homegrown quota. The  champions bought Wilfried Bony from Swansea City for £25m, rising to £28m, in January but Juventus have shown interest in Stevan Jovetic, while Edin Dzeko could leave for Wolfsburg. The loss of Frank Lampard to New York City and possibly James Milner would leave Manuel Pellegrini short of home talent, and Ings could fill the gap.

Two years after his acrimonious departure to Tampa Bay, the shutdown corner again showed his mastery of free agency, signing a vast five-year, $70million deal. With $39m guaranteed, Revis will pocket $16m-a-season in the first three years, NFL insider Ian Raport reports. At 29, the six-time Pro Bowler and four-time All-Pro is among a number of new additions as the Jets look to break their four-year spell without a play-off place. Darrelle Revis defends Jeremy Kerley in the Patriot's narrow 17-16 win over the Jets in December . Revis lasted a year with the Buccaneers after penning a six-year, $96m deal with no guaranteed money. The Patriots moved swiftly following his release last year, with the parties agreeing on a $32m two-year deal. Owner Robert Kraft declined to take up the $20m second-year option, opting to re-sign safety Devin McCourty on big money instead. The deal appears a questionable one for the Super Bowl-winning Patriots. Revis and the recently released Brandon Browner gave them a secondary that was the envy of the AFC. But they lose a locker room leader  to an AFC East rival and Bill Belichick has to rebuild his secondary once more.

She was left out of England's squad for the 3-0 friendly defeat by Germany at Wembley in November and was an unused substitute for the 1-0 defeat by the USA at MK Dons last month. England face four games in just over a week in the annual friendly tournament in Cyprus and Stoney told Fanbookz.com that she feels she merits a recall. ‘My actual form last season was my best since the Women's Super League started,’ she said. ‘When I go away with England I feel I'm competitive and working really hard, so that's all I can keep doing. I'm delighted to be in the England squad and if the opportunity comes, hopefully I can take it. ‘I've played 117 games for England and kept clean sheets against the best teams in the world, so I know that I can do it. It's just a matter of getting the opportunity to show it. Stoney has played just one game for her country under Mark Sampson, who replaced Hope Powell in 2013 . ‘This will be a good chance for the team to try different players and game plans but for me personally, with four matches in just over a week, this is an opportunity to play and show what I can still do.’ Steph Houghton, who succeeded Stoney as captain, and either Lucy Bronze or Laura Bassett have been selected in the centre of defence in recent games. Stoney points to her best fitness results over the lose season, since recovering from a hip injury. ‘You can never lose what you never had and I was never quick in the first place,’ added Stoney. ‘I continue to work hard on trying to read the game well, understanding what's likely to happen. Getting good detail on the opposition allows me to feel one step ahead.’ England play Australia and the Netherlands in their other group games before finishing up with a fourth friendly in Cyprus. At the World Cup in Canada they face France, Mexico and Colombia.", "completion": "response:\n\nArsenal defender Casey Stoney is hoping to prove worth to Mark Sampson .\nStoney has made just one appearance for her country in last 15 months .\nThe ex-England captain is delighted to be back in the Three Lionesses fold ."}

The Czech Republic international is set to leave Stamford Bridge this summer, with the club now prepared to part with the keeper - but only for £10million or above. Given Arsenal and Chelsea's rivalry, a move to the Emirates Stadium for Cech would be hard to broker. Petr Cech, in action for Czech Republic against Latvia last week, is poised to leave Chelsea in the summer . Cech, who joined Chelsea in 2004, has started only four Premier League games this season . And the Gunners want to ensure they have a realistic chance of landing Cech before launching a move, with Chelsea likely to be reluctant to sell to a direct rival. Cech revealed last week that he does not want to spend another season as understudy to first-choice keeper Thiabut Courtois at Stamford Bridge. The 32-year-old Czech Republic international has lost his place to the young Belgian this term, starting only four Premier League games and being primarily used in the domestic cup competitions. Cech revealed last week that he does not want to spend another season as understudy to Thiabut Courtois . 'I don't know what the club's idea will be. It looks like it works well with me and Thibaut as a duo,' Cech said. 'But that can work for one season only. I don't want another one like this.' Cech joined Chelsea in 2004 and has won three Premier League titles, four FA Cups, the Champions League and three League Cups, the last of which was this season when he stared ahead of Courtios for the 2-0 defeat of Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley. 'There always will be speculation, I leave it for the summer,' added Cech. 'It will be important to sit down with the club, with the manager, to consider all the pros and cons. We will see what will work out the best.'", "completion": "response:\n\nArsenal awaiting clarification regarding Chelsea's goalkeeper's future .\nPetr Cech is set to leave Stamford Bridge in the summer .\nGunners interested in Czech Republic stopper, but they want to ensure they have realistic chance of signing him before making formal move .\nCech doesn't want to spend another year as backup toThaibut Courtois .\nChelsea ready to let him leave but want at least £10million for the keeper .\nREAD: Petr Cech's fall down the Chelsea pecking order has been tough to watch, admits goalkeeping coach Christophe Lollichon ."}

According to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, all but one of the hostages were among the at least 220 Assyrians captured on February 23 during an attack on villages in the northern Syrian province of al-Hasakah. The Syrian Observatory had said previously that a self-proclaimed ISIS court ordered the release of 29 Assyrian Christian hostages, citing an Assyrian commander. The reasoning behind the release was not immediately clear. It was also not clear why only 19 people were let go Sunday. The \"court\" told the commander that the fate of the other kidnapped Assyrians has yet to be decided by ISIS Sharia jurists. When the decision was announced that at least some of the hostages would be released, Graeme Wood, with The Atlantic, said he was pleased to hear about it, but not entirely surprised. \"ISIS has claimed for a long time to follow rules, and it claims that these Sharia courts will impose limits,\" he told CNN. \"They can attempt to get credibility by showing that they follow rules and that they have some kind of transparent process that follows their particular implementation of Sharia law.\" Also this weekend, the Syrian Observatory reported that ISIS has killed 1,969 people, since the declaration of its \"caliphate\" last June. Nearly two-thirds of them -- 1,238 people -- were civilians. Six were children and eight were women, the group said. Of the rest, 95 were fighters from the al Qaeda-affiliated rebel group al-Nusra Front, the Syrian Observatory said, and 511 were officers and soldiers of regime forces. ISIS also executed 125 of its own members for \"exceeding the limits in religion,\" the Syrian Observatory said. \"We in SOHR believe that the real number of people that had been killed by (ISIS) is higher than the number documented by SOHR because there are hundreds of missing and detainees inside the (ISIS) jails, loss of communication with about 1,000 men of al-Shaitaat tribe, (and) dozens of Kurds who have still been missing\" since ISIS attacked the Syrian town of Kobani in September.

The colossal sum was demanded because in Finland, fines for speeding are scaled up according to the wealth of the law-breaker – and this one, businessman Reima Kuisla, is a multi-millionaire. After he was caught travelling at 64mph in a 50mph zone, the authorities took a peek at his tax return. Reima Kuisla posted a picture of his speeding ticket on his Facebook page, complaining that the Finnish authorities were making life for the rich difficult . It showed that he earned 6.5m euros (£4.72m) a year, so they dished out a 54,000 euro fine, the Iltalehti newspaper reported. The fine has a logic to it, but Mr Kuisla complained bitterly on his Facebook page about the sum he was asked to hand over. He posted a picture of the ticket and said: ‘Finland is impossible to live in for certain kinds of people who have high incomes and wealth. I’m considering leaving the country.’ However, sympathy levels in Finland for his plight have been fairly low. One user wrote on the Iltalehti website: ‘He should stop complaining and hang his head in shame instead.’ Earlier this week a British tourist who teaches UK police driving skills was fined for speeding in New Zealand after telling a court his father had been 'caught short' and he was taking him urgently to a toilet.

Illfield has invited Hayne to be a guest of honour at the USARL fixtures in their 14-club competition over the summer, adding: 'We are looking at every source for increasing performance outcomes for the USA national team leading up to the 2017 Rugby League World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.'", "completion": "response:\n\nJarryd Hayne quit the NRL in October to try and get into American Football .\nThis week, he signed a three-year contract with the San Francisco 49ers .\nThe chairman of the US Association of Rugby League welcomed his arrival ."}

Motorcyclist Mathew Sant was travelling along Canberra Avenue toward the city on Tuesday in an 80km/h zone when he was rear-ended.

The prodigiously talented wide receiver turns 31 this month, but the move had been widely touted. Deemed an outspoken maverick by many at Soldier Field, he raised eyebrows with a post-game locker room rant after defeat to the Miami Dolphins in October. His appearances as an analyst on 'Inside the NFL' weekly were also said to be a distraction. Brandon Marshall will head to New York on Tuesday for a medical ahead of his move to the Jets . The mercurial Marshall is yet to play in the play-offs . New head coach John Fox and offensive co-ordinator Adam Gase appeared lukewarm about Marshall at best. 'We’re trying to evaluate where everybody fits and how we best use them and, again, trying to put the best football team on the field. He’s part of that process,' Fox told the Chicago Tribune last month. Marshall was close to Jay Cutler - following him to Chicago from Denver via Miami - but raw quarterback Geno Smith could test his short fuse. ESPN broke news of the trade, which will also see the Jets give the Bears a fifth round draft pick. Marshall signed a four-year deal in Chicago last May, and had seven consecutive 1,000 yard seasons before falling short last year - largely due to missing the final three games with a shoulder complaint. Despite the numbers, Marshall is yet to appear in a play-off game. Perhaps that will change in New York. New head coach Todd Bowles was with Marshall during his two-year stint in Miami and will have been influential in the trade. The move will likely mean the end of Percy Harvin's short stint with the Gang Green, with Marshall to pair up with Eric Decker. Marshall was drafted in the fourth round of the 2006 draft by the Broncos and is a mental health spokesman, spreading awareness of his battle with Borderline Personality Disorder.", "completion": "response:\n\nMarshall turns 31 this month and joins his fourth NFL franchise .\nThe talented wide receiver is an outspoken figure in the locker room .\nThe trade likely spells the end for Percy Harvin's short stint with the Jets ."}

The video already has nearly 300,000 views. 'So much America right now,' Ellerman says before beginning his demonstration. First, Ellerman can be seen wrapping bacon around the end of the gun in tin foil. He fires a few rounds as the end of the gun begins to smoke, sending meat filled fumes into the air. 'Oh yeah,' says Ellerman enthusiastically as he unwraps the tin foil to reveal the freshly cooked bacon. After sampling his creation he exclaims,' Yeah! Let's go kill some more pigs,' as his friends erupt in laughter. Those who wish to learn more about Ellerman's antics may do so on his website.

The multi-million-pound development at the Hilton Hotel in Park Lane, Central London, will enable clients to enjoy a cigarette and gamble at the same time, and is expected to be particularly popular with wealthy clients who find the ban on smoking in enclosed public spaces irksome. The move will see a return to the days of Dr No, when Sean Connery as 007 meets the voluptuous Sylvia Trench at Le Cercle club, languidly puts a Morland cigarette to his lips and introduces himself with the immortal line: ‘Bond. James Bond.’ The name's Bond - James Bond: Sean Connery, as 007, lights up a cigarette in a casino in 1962's Dr No . Today, the suave spy would be liable for prosecution for breaking the smoking ban – the reason why a roof garden extension is being added to the hotel’s Park Lane Casino for its aptly named ‘high rollers’. David Mills, the hotel’s operations director, said: ‘Many of our clients come from countries where smoking bans do not apply. We want to provide them with a relaxing and enjoyable experience.’ Gaming tables will be placed on the terrace so that roulette, blackjack, baccarat and three-card poker can be played under the stars, although Westminster Council has banned live and recorded music in case it disturbs nearby residents.

A teenager who grinned for his mugshot after staggering drunk out of a family wedding to carry out a 'terrifying' crime spree involving burglary and sexual assault has been jailed for five and a half years. Connor King, 18, went on a rampage after the reception, breaking into a flat in Folkestone, Kent, where two women and a baby were sleeping. He woke the women and demanded alcohol but when they refused he threatened to kill them and they had to lock themselves in a bedroom. King then went into a second bedroom and attacked a man while he was sleeping, punching him in the head up to 30 times before sexually assaulting him. Canterbury Crown Court heard he then demanded money, picked up a screwdriver and threatened to stab him. When his victim refused he hurled a TV at him. He then assaulted another neighbour who had heard the women's screams and stole a gold sovereign ring, a wallet, a mobile phone and USB cable. King then went next door where he woke a couple and their young child as he climbed out a window to escape, telling them: 'I am going to a party'. Police arrived to find the teenager standing on a window ledge 25ft from the ground before he climbed down and shouted: 'I'm a terrorist'. King admitted six charges of assault, burglary and sexual assault and was sent to a Young Offenders' Institute for five-and-a-half years. Judge Heather Norton told him: 'You embarked on a course of conduct that night which must have been terrifying for everybody involved.' Not smiling anymore: King admitted six charges of assault, burglary and sexual assault at Canterbury Crown Court and was sent to a Young Offenders' Institute for five-and-a-half years .

The attackers then burned down the entire village of Njaba, the sources said. Dozens of gunmen invaded the remote northeastern village before dawn Tuesday, singling out boys and girls between the ages of 13 and 19 and killing them alongside their parents, witnesses said. Njaba village lies about 65 kilometers (40 miles) south of Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state. Karimu Lawani, who escaped to Maiduguri after hiding with eight other people behind the barn of a neighbor, said the attackers came into the village at around 5 a.m. \"They shot dead anyone that tried to flee but spared children younger than 13 years old,\" Lawani said. He and other survivors counted the victims of the massacre before leaving the village some hours later. His account was supported by Faltama Bisika, 62, who lost four grandchildren in the attack. \"They hurled petrol bombs into homes and opened fire on anyone trying to flee. They particularly targeted teenagers and elderly people,\" Bisika said. News of the attack was slow to emerge due to lack of communication following destruction of cell phone towers in the region in previous Boko Haram attacks. \"I only got information of the attack on my village last night,\" said a civilian vigilante from Njaba who asked not to be named. The vigilante said his father was among those killed. The vigilante said he left Njaba for Maiduguri in June to join others fighting against the Islamist radical group. He said he believes the attackers came from Gwoza -- a town on Nigeria's mountainous border with Cameroon that Boko Haram seized last June -- because Njaba \"lies on the route to Gwoza from Maiduguri.\"", "completion": "response:\n\nYoung victims in the village of Njaba, ages 13 to 19 were singled out for killing, witness says .\n\"They hurled petrol bombs into homes and opened fire on anyone trying to flee,\" witness says ."}

Just say \"thank you.\" A new study published this month suggests Neanderthals were more \"cognitively advanced than we give them credit,\" Kansas University's David Frayer said in a release. Frayer, a professor emeritus of anthropology, was a part of the study published in the journal PLOS ONE that looks at eagle talons found in present-day Croatia. The talons are among the thousands of human remains, animal bones and tools originally excavated between 1899 and 1905 in the area by Croatian scientist Dragutin Gorjanovic-Kramberger. Only recently, however, did Frayer identify the cut marks and notches on the 130,000-year-old bones as ones modified by humans. \"I was stunned,\" Frayer said of the discovery.  \"It's so obvious that these are cut.\" The markings, including polishes and areas where the bones were \"rubbed together,\" show that the talons were \"manipulated into a piece of jewelry,\" Frayer said. Frayer co-wrote \"Evidence for Neanderthal Jewelry: Modified White-tailed Eagle Claws at Krapina\" with three other Croatian scientists. Their research indicates Neanderthals were more than just the cavemen-like characters depicted in Geico commercials, but sophisticated creatures concerned with ornamentation and possibly even an \"advanced level of prowess\" in catching birds, according to Frayer. \"We can't prove it, but we suspect that they were catching these birds,\" he said. Even with modern technology, catching an eagle is an enormously difficult thing to do.  Frayer believes Neanderthals must have had excellent \"planning skills and ritual\" they would've used in catching the bird. \"Neanderthals are often thought of to be simple-minded mumbling, bumbling, stumbling fools,\" Frayer said. \"But the more we know about them the more sophisticated they've become.\"", "completion": "response:\n\nResearchers say marking on eagle talons prove Neanderthals made jewelry .\nEagle bones used in study more than 130,000 years old .\nScientist: \"It really shows a level of technical sophistication\""}

So luckily for this father, a pair of raccoons took it upon themselves to make his job a little easier by giving a little demonstration in the garden. The hilarious footage captured in Seattle begins innocently enough with some excited children looking out of the window at two raccoons scaling their fence. The children watch on excitedly as the male raccoon chases the female from the fence and into the garden . As the youngsters speculate about whether they will jump from the fence – before a little ‘muffin man’ song interlude – one of the raccoons descends into the garden closely pursued by the other. One child, sensing the tension, asks: ‘Can raccoons fight?’ While another exclaims: ‘Woah, they’re wrestling.’ As one raccoon mates the other, the children begin to laugh and the father responds quickly be saying: ‘They’re doing more than wrestling I think.’ Laughing along in the excitement, the father continues to film the episode in the garden until one of the children offers up an explanation in the form of a question: ‘Is he doing the Heimlich manoeuvre?’ The children laugh hysterically as the two raccoons begin mating and offer up a number of innocent explanations for their behaviour . ‘I think so,’ replies one of the children before the father confidently states: ‘Yes, that’s the Heimlich.’ Raccoons usually mate between late January and mid-March, in a period triggered by increasing daylight. During the mating season, males spend much of their time searching for females in an attempt to copulate in the three-to-four day period when conception is possible.

That was the question left still unanswered at the end of Sunday night's season finale of \"The Walking Dead,\" and a finale record 15.8 million viewers tuned in to find out the answer. Rick was back in \"Ricktatorship\" mode, telling the residents of Alexandria that he knew what it took to survive and they should follow him. That led up to one of many moments where we gasped during the 90-minute finale. Here are five of the biggest gaspworthy moments: . 1. Morgan is back . We've literally been looking for him all season, and Rick's old friend Morgan -- going all the way back to the first episode -- made a return appearance, wielding a stick he used to kick walker, and human, butt when necessary. And it was definitely necessary once he was captured by two men wearing W's on their heads, who, we would later learn, wanted to turn Morgan into a walker in order to join a horde of walkers they controlled. 2. Daryl looks done for . It was Daryl who happened upon that horde, and he and Aaron were soon surrounded and forced into a car, with little chance of escape -- that is, until Morgan rescued them. We rarely believe what we hear when there are rumors that Daryl might die, but that was a close one. 3. Carol and her casserole . Melissa McBride continues to steal scenes left and right lately, and her threatening of Pete while lending him a casserole may be one of the best scenes in the series' history so far. 4. Glenn gets shot . We seriously thought Glenn was a goner after a vengeful Nicholas shot him, then left him for a large group of walkers to attack. Somehow, Glenn survived and attacked Nicholas, but stopped short of killing him. That's our Glenn, always doing the right thing when it comes down to it. 5. Rick's memorable walker encounter . Just when you thought you'd seen everything, Rick literally squeezed a walker's neck then discharged a round causing the walker to spray out blood -- a walker he presented to the residents of Alexandria, in a bid to lead them toward survival. Rick was then rudely interrupted by Pete, who slashed Reg's throat in a fit of anger. At that point, Deanna told Rick to off Pete, which he did. Phew!

President Vladimir Putin has accused Western spies of plotting to undermine his rule and trying to 'destabilise' Russia before the elections. Public organisations are being used by Western security services to achieve their own goals, the Russian president said at a meeting of the Federal Security Service earlier today. He vowed that Russia would stand firm in the face of what he described as attempts to isolate the country politically and economically following the Ukrainian crisis. In the speech he said: 'The attempts by Western security services to use public, non-governmental organisations and non-political groups for their own benefit, mostly to discredit the authorities and destabilise the situation in Russia, have not stopped. 'Actions are being planned for the time before the election campaigns in 2016 and 2018.' Putin approved a law to force non-governmental organisations that engage in 'political activity' to register with the Justice Ministry as 'foreign agents' and file a report to officials every quarter in 2012. Critics claimed it was a move designed to try and silence groups that criticised his human rights record. His new comments mean that Moscow will not relax their scrutiny of non-governmental groups that receive foreign funding. Putin added that he was always open to dialogue with the opposition - but was confident the country would come out as a winner in the standoff against the West. He said: 'The situation around our country will change for the better, but not because we will make concessions, bend down or trifle with someone. 'No one has succeeded in scaring our country or pressuring it and no one will.' Putin spoke before officials and said he was confident Russia would come out as a winner in the standoff against the West .

When they asked for entries, organisers expected a modest response. Yesterday it emerged that more than 800 schools had applied for a share of a £25,000 book fund.

'Children don’t want physical books to be replaced, they already spend so much time on the internet and devices so books actually provide them with a break from that.' To earn a share of the fund, which was donated by best-selling crime author James Patterson, schools were asked to respond to the statement: Why I can’t live without books. Miss Grant and a panel of judges then drew up a shortlist, selected for their creativity and passion for books. The £10,000 first prize went to Hexthorpe Primary in Doncaster. Six other schools split the remaining £15,000 between themselves. She added: ‘World Book Day is all about the celebration of traditional books. Children can go into a bookshop with a £1 World Book Day token and get an actual physical book. 'So many children don’t have access to physical books so this is an opportunity for them to get one. There is definitely a huge demand.

Now, scientists have confirmed there is truth in the old adage – at least when it comes to salaries. A study claims friendly staff receive lower wages than their less agreeable colleagues. Despite working just as hard, they are often reluctant to push for pay rises, too focused on team work and overly concerned about being liked. Researchers at the University of Sheffield made the discovery while looking at the impact of personality traits on workers' productivity and pay. A University of Sheffield study claims friendly staff receive lower wages than their less agreeable colleagues . Their study found: 'More agreeable workers tend to earn less in the actual labour market, but their productivity is similar when measured in the laboratory setting.' They defined agreeableness as being compliant, modest, trustworthy and sympathetic. The study found women were most likely to show agreeable personality traits, perhaps one reason for the gender pay gap. Being agreeable made workers more successful in team work, but had three negative effects on their performance. Friendly staff are often reluctant to push for pay rises, too focused on team work and overly concerned about being liked, according to the study . 'First, helping others may reduce individual productivity,' the study found. 'Secondly, agreeable people may be less effective when bargaining their wage. Finally, agreeable individuals may enter less stable, lower paid occupations.' The study was presented at the Royal Economic Society's 2015 annual conference in Manchester yesterday by Ana Nuevo-Chiquero, of The University of Sheffield, who conducted the research alongside Australian and Spanish academics. They analysed the personalities and productivity levels of students at the University of New South Wales in laboratory conditions, and analysed a host of academic reports on personality and wages. It found that, while conscientious and emotionally stable workers earn more money, being too open could harm your career. While openness with colleagues indicated an artistic, curious and imaginative worker, it could make them less likely to obey the rules, which could cause problems at a formal workplace. Neuroticism, which researchers linked to mood swings and unpredictability, also impacted performance as these workers often lacked self-confidence and were insecure.", "completion": "response:\n\nStudy found friendly staff receive lower wages than unpleasant colleagues .\nThey are often reluctant to push for pay rise and too focused on team work .\nUniversity of Sheffield researchers looked at impact of personality traits ."}

A writer and photographer for the magazine accompanied a team of scientists to Honduras' Mosquitia region on the trail of a legendary \"White City\" or \"City of the Monkey God.\" The expedition was launched after aerial light detection scanning  -- known as LIDAR -- uncovered what appeared to be man-made structures below the rainforest, National Geographic said. Seeking to confirm the discovery, a team of U.S. and Honduran archaeologists, a LIDAR engineer, an ethnobotanist, anthropologists and documentary filmmakers entered the remote region. They were protected by Honduran Special forces, the magazine said. Writer Douglas Preston said the team emerged February 25, after documenting the ruins of a \"vanished culture.\" \"In contrast to the nearby Maya, this vanished culture has been scarcely studied and it remains virtually unknown. Archaeologists don't even have a name for it,\" Douglas wrote. Archaeologists no longer believed in the existence of a single \"White City,\" he said, instead believing there had been an entire civilization with many cities. The expedition found earth works, including an earthen pyramid as well as a collection of stone sculptures, thought to potentially have been burial offerings. Archaeologist Oscar Neil Cruz from the Honduran Institute of Anthropology and History (IHAH) estimated they dated from A.D. 1000 to 1400, Douglas wrote. The researchers were greeted by wildlife which appeared never before to have seen humans, wandering unafraid through their camp. \"This is clearly the most undisturbed rain forest in Central America. The importance of this place can't be overestimated,\" ethnobotanist Mark Plotkin told National Geographic. The team left their finds unexcavated and are keeping the exact location of the site secret in an attempt to prevent looting. But in his article, Douglas warned that that the area was nonetheless under threat, with illegal logging for cattle farming within a dozen miles. IHAH director Virgilio Paredes Trapero told National Geographic that the forest and valley could disappear within eight years unless action was taken. \"The Honduran government is committed to protecting this area, but doesn't have the money.

And this was a quick delivery, so quick in fact that the two did not make it to the hospital in time and Helm had to step up and deliver his daughter Rylee in the back of his car. Detroit Red Wings star and his longtime girlfriend Devon Englot welcomed a baby girl, Rylee (above) on Monday . After Helm won in overtime Sunday night (left), he went home and got to bed but was woken up shortly after midnight by Englot (right with Helm and their daughter Reece) who was in labor . The Red Wings report that Helm started gathering their things when he got the news that the baby was coming, phoning the hospital from his home as he loaded the car. Englot however, who is also the mother of another child, the couple's 3-year-old daughter Reece, started to feel things moving a little too fast. 'Devon kept on saying that she had the urge to push,' Helm said. And Helm realized what that meant. 'They said when the baby’s ready, the baby’s ready. She can’t really control much about it. We tried to make it there. She tried to hold her back,' he said. 'They’ve always told us the second one comes quicker, but we didn’t expect it to be that quick.' Mom, dad and big sister are all doing fine now . The couple were a mile away from the Providence Park Hospital in Novi, Michigan, when Helm got in the backseat and delivered their baby. 'It came on so quick. We thought we had lots of time to get to the hospital and things just took a turn and the baby was ready to come out to say hello and that’s what she did,' he explained. Five minutes later, they were back on their way to the hospital with their new passenger. 'We got to the ER and they kept assuring us that things were going to be OK after they got a good look at the baby and Devon was feeling good,' said Helm. 'After that things slowly calmed down. It took us awhile to kind of get over what happened, but things are moving along pretty well.'", "completion": "response:\n\nDetroit Red Wings star and his longtime girlfriend Devon Englot welcomed a baby girl, Rylee on Monday .\nAfter Helm won in overtime Sunday night, he went home and got to bed but was woken up shortly after midnight by Englot who was in labor .\nA mile away from the hospital she said she could not wait any longer, and within five minutes the baby was out .\nAll three, and the couple's daughter Reece, 3, are doing fine ."}

But these days, it seems, you’re just as likely to find a ‘library’ in a three-bedroom suburban house. The quiet allure of a room filled with books, a cosy chair in the corner and a lamp or two has become a new status symbol, estate agents say. Status symbol: Many home owners are turning under-used rooms into quiet refuges from the modern world . And getting your own library isn’t too difficult. Many homeowners are simply redecorating their under-used dining rooms, which have become redundant as more families use a combined kitchen-diner for meals. Estate agents say a library is ‘aspirational’ and regarded as a retro retreat from the rest of our increasingly hi-tech homes. One in ten said there had been a rise in the number of homes being advertised with a library, the National Association of Estate Agents found. Yesterday, Mark Hayward, of the NAEA, said: ‘Having a library in your home can add a unique advantage when it comes to selling your property. It is a differentiator – a room by its very title that conveys peace, quiet and serenity that’s growing in popularity. ‘At the top-end property market, it adds a quintessential English touch, popular amongst overseas investors.’ It follows a trend for ‘shelfies’ – photographs of one’s bookshelves – which have become popular on social media websites. More than 160,000 images have been posted on the website Instagram using the hashtag ‘shelfie’, with thousands more on Twitter. Mr Hayward said many upmarket new-build homes now included library rooms as standard, while sellers were converting their spare rooms. He said: ‘The popularity of the kitchen-diner means many dining rooms are now dead space. Filling it with books and calling it a library elevates it again. ‘The books you put on the shelves are intended to reflect a lifestyle. It is filled with the books you want people to think you are reading.’ The name may evoke images of leather bound books and mahogany but libraries are increasingly common .", "completion": "response:\n\nLibraries, a  quiet retreat from gadgets, found increasingly in homes .\nEstate agents say rooms are aspirational and quintessentially English .\nDining rooms are being traded in for the book-filled sanctuaries .\nFollows shelfie trend, pictures of books people own on their shelves ."}

But Miguel Gonzales got a little more than he bargained for when he won the girl - and a two-day suspension. Gonzales, 17, borrowed the horse from a friend's ranch and galloped right on up to Catalina Hernandez's first period class, holding a sign that said 'Will you ride with me to prom?' Miguel Gonzales, 17, got a little help from a horse named Romeo to ask Catalina Hernandez to the prom . The Milpitas High School senior got the idea from the school's Spirit Day theme, which was 'salad dressing day'. He dressed up as a cowboy, boots and all, to represent ranch dressing. Hernandez was dressed in a toga to symbolize Caesar salad. Hernandez and her peers ran out of their classrooms, phones in hand, and she quickly said yes. But the students' principal was hardly excited by the grand gesture. 'I was there for a bit and I knew people would come like security so I tried to leave,' Gonzales told the San Jose Mercury News. The Milpitas High School senior was suspended for his grand gesture, as the school deemed the horse was a 'potential threat' to other students walking in the same path. But Gonzales will still be able to attend the prom . 'But on my way I heard the principal screaming... I kind of knew I was going to get into trouble.' Gonzales said he expected to get detention or Saturday school, but had no idea he could face suspension. District Superintendent Cheryl Jordan said Gonzales was suspended because the horse was a 'potential threat' to other students who where 'walking in the same path.' The teenager said his only regret was not talking to the principal beforehand about his grand plan and 'trying to figure out a way to do it where I wouldn't get into trouble'.

He recalls two alleged racist incidents, the first shortly after he won a gold medal at the European Indoor Championships in 1986. Linford Christie, now an athletics coach, has spoken of allegedly racist treatment at the hands of policeman . ‘I remember when I got my Great Britain tracksuit, I was so proud,’ he said. ‘I walked along Shepherd’s Bush, this policeman started saying, “What’s a n***** like you doing in a British tracksuit?” 'I went into a chip shop and came out of the shop, and he jumped me, twisted my arm behind my back, and arrested me. The next day they dropped all charges. It was just so stupid.’ Another time, he said, police refused to believe he was the owner of a sponsored car and arrested him.

The unnamed man, who is in his 60s, was one of thousands of Western men who visit Russia every year to find love. It is not known where or how he met his young wife, but he assumed that she would not be allowed into the EU without a visa. A French pensioner was arrested for trying to smuggle his new Russian bride home in a suitcase -before discovering she was free to travel anywhere in the EU (file picture) Because of these fears, he 'folded' her into a suitcase and placed her in the luggage rack of a train as he set off back to Nice, in southern France. At Terespol station, on the border between Poland and Belarus, the woman was found by immigration officials, who immediately arrested the couple. After searching the suitcase, Polish customs spokesman Dariusz Sienicki said: 'The Russian wife of the owner of the bag was inside.' There were initial fears that she might have been kidnapped or abused in some other way, however it became clear that she was fine. Mr Sienicki added: 'She was in good shape and wasn't in need of any medical attention.' Despite this, the arrests were deemed valid because the couple had attempted to avoid border controls, which is a criminal offence. The newly-married couple were on their way back to Nice (pictured), France, when their bizarre ploy was rumbled . The wives of men with EU passports can  travel wherever they like in the EU, so if the woman had simply sat next to her husband there would have been no problem. The Russian bride was said to be in her thirties and extremely supple, making it relatively easy for her to fit inside the suitcase. The couple had risked a three-year jail sentence by attempting to evade border control. Mr Sienicki said: 'This was the first time I've seen someone travel like this. She very well could have been a victim of human trafficking.'

You want to beat him as often as you can and Saturday will be no different. Last weekend was the first time since 2010 that all four Welsh regions won against Irish provinces.

The men will appear at Waltham Forest Magistrates' Court on March 25 'regarding a police application for football banning orders', Scotland Yard said. Controversy erupted last month when Chelsea fans were filmed singing racist chants and refusing to let a black man on a train ahead of the Champions League clash against Paris St Germain. Souleymane S, a black man, was prevented getting on a train by Chelsea fans in Paris in February . Fans appeared to be chanting: 'We're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it' Footage captured by a bystander before Chelsea drew 1-1 with Paris Saint-Germain appeared to show a man being pushed back on to the platform amid chants of 'We're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it'. The commuter, identified only as 33-year-old Souleymane, said later he felt 'truly wounded to the bottom of my heart'. He said: 'We're in 2015, aren't we, and we're in France. We're in a civilised country and when you are in a civilised country there are certain things you can't do. 'For me, it's a humiliation. I was humiliated in my country. I was humiliated in front of my family, humiliated in front of my mother and father.' In light of the incident, Scotland Yard said it would examine the footage to establish whether police could make an application for football banning orders. Chelsea FC said previously it was 'appalled' and apologised to the victim, while manager Jose Mourinho said he was 'ashamed' of the fans involved. Souleymane has said he is still traumatised and would not accept the invitation to watching the second leg at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night.

Ten new avalanches were reported early Monday morning, without any casualties. Over the weekend, a total of 40 avalanches hit the area, said Bab Jan Hakimi, head of disaster response at the Afghan Red Crescent Society. Rescue operations and emergency assistance by air and ground are still ongoing, Hakimi said. However, authorities fear the toll will grow much higher since rescue personnel have yet to reach the worst affected areas. President Ashraf Ghani, who visited the area on Saturday, declared three days of mourning in Afghanistan for the victims. Panjshir is a small, mountainous province north of the capital, Kabul.

Jerry Brown unveiled an emergency $1 billion spending plan Thursday to tackle the state's historic drought. A staggering 11 trillion gallons are needed for California to recover from the emergency. Senate President pro Tempore Kevin de León said the legislation will include two bills that will speed up contracting funds to \"manage the drought and strengthen our infrastructure.\" According to the California State Water Resources Control Board, the package will specifically accelerate $128 million from the governor's budget to provide direct assistance to workers and affected communities. Proposition 1 funding, which enacted the Water Quality, Supply, and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2014, will funnel $272 million into safe drinking water efforts and maintenance of water recycling infrastructure. Some $660 million from Prop 1 will also be accelerated for flood protection in urban and rural areas. As part of the changes, Brown said additional measures will crack down on water inefficiency as California enters the fourth year of a worsening-water crisis. \"This unprecedented drought continues with no signs yet of letting up,\" said Brown. \"But we have a lot of good policies coming.\" To exacerbate matters, weather conditions are continuing to diminish natural resources. The Sierra Nevada snowpack, which Californians rely on heavily during the summer for their water needs, is at a near record low. The March snowpack measurement came in at 0.9 inches of water content in the snow, just 5% of the March 3 historical average for the measurement site. The overall water content for the Northern Sierra snowpack came in at 4.4 inches, just 16% of average for the date. Central and southern Sierra readings were 5.5 inches (20% of average) and 5 inches (22% of average) respectively. Only in 1991 has the water content of the snow been lower. \"The drought isn't letting up, so we can't let up either,\" Assembly Speaker Toni Atkins said. \"This legislation will deliver relief to Californians harmed by the drought and help us manage the significant problems the drought continues to cause. Since our skies are still clear, our job is too. And making sure we meet emergency needs, prepare for short term problems and advance longer-term projects are an important part of that effort.\" Brown anticipates his emergency package to move into action immediately.

According to authorities, Phillip Poissonnier of Post Falls was given a ride home by police around 1am on Monday after being thrown out of Club Tequila when he was ten beers in.

Over the years, the boardwalk deteriorated and, following a string of fatal accidents in 1999 and 2000, the government demolished the access points to the walkway. The reopening, which comes over a year since reconstruction efforts kicked off, coincides with Spain's annual Holy Week celebrations.

Striker Callum Wilson stood with his back to goal as opposition goalkeeper Simon Moore attempted to take a goal kick during his side's clash with Cardiff City, only for Moore's clearance to hit the forward. The ball cannoned off the back of the number 13 before hitting the bar, and Wilson, who was signed by Howe from League One outfit Coventry City, then tapped the ball into the empty net. Callum Wilson is standing still outside of the box with his back to goal when the goalkeeper kicks the ball . Wilson and the fans celebrated, but referee Lee Mason was quick to disallow the goal and booked the 23-year-old Bournemouth top scorer, much to Howe's frustration. 'I've got to be very careful with what I say, we've been in a bit of trouble recently with officials,' Howe told BBC Radio Solent. Howe continued: 'Callum (Wilson) did that all night. He didn't move, didn't follow the keeper, he held his ground and by the laws of the game that is perfectly acceptable. It's a goal that should have stood.' Bournemouth striker Wilson just cannot believe his goal has been disallowed by referee Lee Mason . 'You'll have to ask the referee why the goal was not allowed, I don't think he had a particularly good game and that's an understatement. 'Callum was looking the other way, he stood his ground which is allowed and the goalkeeper has kicked it at his back. 'That's a real strange decision and ultimately it's cost us two points.'", "completion": "response:\n\nCallum Wilson was denied a goal against Cardiff City by referee Lee Mason .\nMason instead booked the striker who slotted home an opportunistic effort .\nWilson was hit by the goalkeeper's kick and the ball cannoned onto the bar .\nStriker tapped the ball home, but referee Mason was having none of it ."}

In a speech to staff, Tony Hall will say he backs plans to overhaul the licence fee ‘to reflect changing times’. Lord Hall reveals he is open to a new universal levy on every household in the country – even those that do not own a television set or only watch programmes online or on catch-up services. BBC director-general Tony Hall, who says he will back plans to overhaul the licence fee 'to reflect changing times' This would lead to an estimated 500,000 extra households having to pay for a service they do not use or currently get free. The director-general’s speech at Broadcasting House in London comes just a week after a report by the MPs on the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee said the £145.50-a-year TV licence fee system was outdated and should be replaced. The debate has stepped up a gear as negotiations on renewing the BBC’s Royal Charter in 2016 get under way. Expressing the BBC’s view, Lord Hall is expected to say: ‘We’ve always said that the licence fee should be updated to reflect changing times. ‘I welcome the committee’s endorsement of our proposal to make people pay the licence fee even if they only watch catch-up television. ‘The committee has suggested another route to modernising the licence fee – a universal household levy. Both proposals have the same goal in mind: adapting the licence fee for the internet age. Lord Hall made the speech to staff at BBC Broadcasting House, pictured, just a week after a report by the MPs on the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee said the £145.50-a-year TV licence fee system was outdated and should be replaced . ‘I believe we need and we will need what the licence fee – in whatever form – makes happen more than ever.’ A universal tax would remove the need for the BBC to pursue those who do not pay the licence fee – a costly system that leads to a loss of between £196million - £235million a year. But ministers say the earliest it could be introduced would be 2026. A subscription system advocated by the select committee, is opposed by Lord Hall as ‘poor value’. He will warn that it could fatally diminish the BBC’s ability to compete on digital platforms with other providers such as Netflix, Google and Apple.", "completion": "response:\n\nBBC director-general Tony Hall made a speech at Broadcasting House .\nSaid he will back plans to overhaul licence fee 'to reflect changing times'\nWill be aimed at those who don't own a TV or only watch catch-up services .\nEstimated an extra 500,000 households will pay for a service they don't use .\nComes after licence fee was branded outdated in a report by MPs last week ."}

Anti-drugs lessons in schools may encourage pupils to try illegal substances rather than steer clear of them, Government experts have warned (file picture) The board, which hit the headlines in 2009 after its then-chairman Professor David Nutt was fired for suggesting that alcohol and tobacco were more harmful than many illegal drugs, passed its findings to Home Secretary Theresa May last month, the Daily Telegraph reported. It urged the government to cut funding unless there is good evidence that anti-drugs initiatives, such as 2003’s ‘Talk to Frank’ campaign are working. The report also said that hard-hitting school talks by policemen may make drugs appear ‘sexy’ to teenagers, while adverts that intended to conjure a ‘fear’ of drugs were also criticised as potentially counter-productive. Many schools have already switched to behaviour-led measures that help children to avoid peer pressure, but experts have urged for faster and more wide-covering progress. Its report said prevention classes that have been taught for generations were ‘ineffective at changing behaviour’ and ‘may even increase the risk of drug use’ (file picture) However, the report does concede that there is growing evidence of the importance of teaching drug prevention as part of a broader strategy to improve national health. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘Preventing and reducing drug misuse is a key part of our drug strategy and there are positive signs our approach is working. ‘There has been a long term downward trend in drug use over the last decade, the number of heroin and crack cocaine users in England continues to decline, and more people are recovering from their dependency now than in 2009-10. ‘Our evidence-based approach recognises the importance of having a range of prevention initiatives to give individuals the confidence to resist drugs.

Different type of midfield players but whoever gets the upper hand could have a decisive influence on the result.

Suddenly, one tourist catches a glimpse of the subject of one of the photos: a man whose eyes have been gouged out. Manjula Sharma, visiting the United Nations from India, gasps when she realizes what she is looking at. \"How could anybody do this?\" she said, while looking at the photos with a pained expression. \"It's not war. It's not drought. It's not natural calamity. It's torture.\" The exhibit is tucked away behind the lobby of the U.N. Secretariat Building.

Captions on the photos show that many of them were taken inside military hospitals, and accuse Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime in the torture and killings. The photos show emaciated bodies. Some have eyes gouged out, some have genitals removed. And many are covered with wounds, the flesh peeling from their bodies. It's a sight that gave pause to Anders Frantzen, who works at the United Nations and was running late to a meeting. \"I told myself I really wanted to come back here and take a proper look.

That's partly why Mouaz Moustafa, senior political adviser to the Coalition for a Democratic Syria, said he placed the photos in this location. He wanted to bring awareness to the public and put pressure on U.N. Security Council member states to vote for the International Criminal Court to prosecute war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria. \"If you ask anyone about ISIS from Mississippi to Alabama, everyone is so well aware of this obviously evil entity,\" Moustafa said. \"If you compare it to the horrendous crimes of the Assad regime, it doesn't get, I feel, it doesn't get the same coverage.\" The Syrian Mission to the United Nations did not respond to repeated requests for comment on the exhibit.

Having a group of athletic, testosterone-fuelled players surrounding you, trying to intimidate and bully you into making a decision which favours them, is almost too much to bear.

Chelsea's players surround referee Bjorn Kuipers as he sends off Zlatan Ibrahimovic (second right) Some observers will suggest that referees could just brandish cards at players who apply too much pressure.

Professor Christian Graugaard said the changes would help students understand the differences between what they see in pornography and the reality of sex. His suggestion echoes similar calls made in Britain last year  by a government-backed sexual health forum, which said youngsters must be taught that pornography does not reflect real life. Danish students could soon be watching pornography films in class in order to teach them the differences between what they see on screen and the reality of sex . Mr Graugaard told public broadcaster DR: 'Instead of having sex education be boring and technical, where you roll a condom onto a cucumber, I'd rather have us educate our children to be critical consumers who see porn with a certain distance and reflection,' according to The Local. He added that teenagers attempting to copy what they saw in pornography was a 'recipe for broken necks and disappointment'. Denmark is known for its liberal attitudes to pornography - it was the first country to legalise it, and a recent survey showed three quarters of Danish men, and a third of Danish women, regularly watch it, The Local reported. Early last year in Britain, a document drawn up by sexual health charity Brook, the PSHE Association and the Sex Education Forum issued new guidelines for sex education in schools. The guidelines, criticised by an education campaigner for 'taking children's childhoods away from them' - also called for students to be told about the dangers of 'sexting' - sending explicit text messages - and sharing sexual photos and images. Pupils must instead be taught the difference between real-life relationships and the distorted world of X-rated films. This could involve playing card games in class to decide whether various sexual scenarios belong on ‘Planet Earth’ or ‘Planet Porn’ and a greater emphasis on relationships, sexuality and staying safe, rather than just the 'mechanics' of reproduction.", "completion": "response:\n\nDanish sexology professor calls for students to be shown porn at school .\nProfessor Christian Graugaard said it would help illustrate the reality of sex .\nTeenagers attempting to mimic porn a 'recipe for disappointment', he said ."}

But as Australia and New Zealand go head-to-head in the World Cup final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday, the underarm bowling incident from 1981 will inevitably come back to haunt. The  controversial bowl triggered a cold war between the two nations after the infamous day  on February 1 when New Zealand needed six runs with one ball remaining to draw the match.

Scroll down for video . It was a single bowl that triggered a massive uproar at the time when Aussie bowler delivered an underarm . As the ball gently rolled down the pitch, McKechnie blocked the ball before he tossed his bat to the ground out of anger and disgust. Australia went on to win the match but the hell that followed left the Chappell brothers struggling to cope under the pressure from the backlash.

The Team Sky rider was reacting to claims made in the Cycling Independent Reform Commission report, which was published on Monday. In it one ‘respected cycling professional’ is said to believe that 90 per cent of the peloton are still benefiting from performance-enhancing drugs. Geraint Thomas has taken aim at CIRC's report into doping in elite cycling, branding the findings as insulting . The report alleges that the UCI acted favourably to Armstrong to protect the sport and that doping still takes place in the sport. However, unlike in Armstrong's days, its says riders now have a choice to dope or not . That, according to Thomas, is rubbish. ‘I think it’s a hell of a lot cleaner,’ he told the BBC. ‘I didn’t race back then, but some of the stories you hear… it’s certainly not like that now. ‘Whole teams were doing it back then. ‘It’s insulting when people say it [cycling] is really filthy and saying I’m doing something wrong. I dedicate everything to this. ‘You look at older riders – they are the most cynical about it all because they don’t know any other way. ‘Look at Brad [Wiggins] and [Chris] Froome.

The richest fight of all time will not come cheap either — for Sky Sports or their subscribers — even though Sky are keeping faith with their core following by keeping the base price below £20. It has taken what is described by industry insiders as ‘a very substantial offer’ for Sky to fend off fierce competition from Frank Warren’s BoxNation. Floyd Mayweather's hotly-anticipated bout with Manny Pacquiao will be shown on Sky Sports . Pacquiao headed for the playground after working out in Los Angeles previously . The price for the fight has been set at £19.95 until midnight of Friday May 1. The cost will remain the same for those paying via remote control or online, but will be £24.95 if booked via phone after Friday. Sky are flirting with their threshold of £20 by charging £19.95 a buy on their Sports Box Office channel until midnight on May 1, rising to £24.95 on May 2, the day of the fight in Las Vegas. Since they are understood to have broken past protocol by offering the US promoters a cut of that revenue as well as a hefty up-front payment, it is expected they will have to shatter the pay-per-view record in this country to break even. The current Sky record stands at 1.2million buys for Ricky Hatton’s Vegas loss to Mayweather in 2007. Warren is believed to have offered a higher lump sum than Sky in the hope of attracting another two million customers to his £12-a-month subscription channel.

Chelsea were knocked out of the last-16 on away goals on Wednesday night after the tie against PSG finished 3-3 on aggregate. And yet again it was another barren night for Costa, who has failed to score a single goal in seven Champions League appearances - a total of eight hours and 28 minutes of action - this season. Diego Costa shows his frustrations during Chelsea's Champions League exit on Wednesday night . PSG defender David Luiz gestures towards Costa during the 2-2 Champions League draw at Stamford Bridge .

Located under the majestic Andes Mountain range, the unique hotel is right in the middle of one of the most valued - and endangered - regions in the world. Aside from simply relaxing inside the one of a kind hotel, venturing into the rainforest offers guests the opportunity to spot many unique animals, such as the Pudu Deer, which is the world's smallest at just 13 inches tall. Inside, the five-floor hotel boasts an all-natural decor in its 13 small rooms, as well as several hot tubs carved out of gigantic tree trunks, and an intimate bar and restaurant area. But to experience the 'erupting' hotel, guests will need to brave a swinging rope bridge to enter, as it is only accessible by foot.

Scudamore has also revealed a shot at the Grade One Celebration Chase at Sandown on April 25 is one of the options for Grand Annual Chase winner Next Sensation. Monbeg Dude, the gelding part owned by former England rugby union captain Mike Tindall and fellow international James Simpson-Daniel, was a never-dangerous 14th in the Ultima Business Solutions Handicap Chase under Paul Carberry. Trainer Michael Scudamore has given Monbeg Dude the green light to race at the Grand National . Scudamore has run a series of tests on the 10-year-old, who was seventh in last year’s National. With the results coming up negative, Scudamore believes the most likely reason for Monbeg Dude’s below par effort was his resentment of a tongue tie being fitted for the first time. The trainer said: ‘We were disappointed with his Cheltenham run but he has come back fine. There is no reason not to run at Aintree and the tongue tie will be left off. ‘We think maybe he did not enjoy running in it even though he has plenty of experience of it being fitted at home.’ Tom Scudamore celebrates winning the A.P. McCoy Grand Annual Handicap Chase with New Sensation . Scudamore is not thinking of Aintree for Next Sensation and the gelding has options at both Ayr and Punchestown but the trainer is tempted by the Celebration Chase. Scudamore added: ‘We are looking at Ayr and Punchestown, although my only worry about Ireland, given he is a nervy character, is the travelling. The Celebration Chase is in the back of my mind. They are talking of taking (2014 winner) Sire De Grugy there but there are usually only five or six runners.’ Scudamore will discuss Monbeg Dude jockey plans in the next week and also looking for a rider is Neil Mulholland, whose The Druids Nephew, a 12-1 Grand National shot, won the Cheltenham race they both contested. Barry Geraghty is hoping to return for the Punchestown Festival after falling and breaking his shinbone . Mulholland has lost both first choice Barry Geraghty, who broke shinbone in a fall on Sunday, and second choice Davy Russell, who broke his arm 24 hours earlier. Geraghty is hoping to be back in action for the Punchestown Festival which starts on April 28.

Liverpool midfielder Jordan Henderson (left) pressures Manchester City's James Milner for the ball . Liverpool playmaker Philippe Coutinho (right) had an outstanding game against Manchester City . 'If I was a Manchester City player, I'd be embarrassed how easy it is to play through them,' Neville said during live commentary on Sky Sports. 'We're judging Manchester City as champions of the Premier League. There has to be progression year on year, you have to get better. But this team, we keep seeing the same mistakes being made' Prior to the Liverpool game, questions had been raised over Pellegrini's decision to play with two strikers and leave his midfield exposed. With flair players David Silva and Samir Nasri also not fulfilling their defensive duties, the Chilean's bold selections appeared to have signalled some oversight. And in the post-match analysis, Carragher offered his opinion: 'To employ that system (4-4-2) in the big games is so naive. It's embarrassing really for a manager at that level to go into a game against Barcelona two years running and then again at Anfield like this. 'Something is not right about City and there has to be changes at the end of the season.'

Aswat, who is thought to be 40, was arrested in 2005 in Zambia and later flown to the UK. He fought extradition for several years and was held at Broadmoor Hospital before being sent to the US last October. In January the European Court of Human Rights dismissed a case he brought against the British Government arguing that his extradition rested on inadequate assurances from US officials about his treatment. His lawyers claimed that it had breached Article 3 (prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment) of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Prosecutors say Aswat (background) and Hamza conspired to create a terrorist training camp in Bly, Oregon, 15 years ago . In their ruling at the time, ECHR judges said: 'In light of the specific assurances and additional information received from the United States government, and the careful examination of the case by the High Court in the United Kingdom, the court found that it could not be said that there was a real risk that Mr Aswat would be subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 if extradited.

But in Bethlehem, runners say they run to be free. \"We are trying to inspire people to take their own rights,\" says organizer Signe Fischer, \"and the right of movement is the only right that you can physically just claim. You can put on your running shoes and just take it.\" The Palestine Marathon is put on by the Palestine Olympic Committee and the Right to Movement, a nonprofit organization that uses running as a means of activism. They focus their efforts on what they see as one of the most basic rights: movement. Many of the runners are Palestinian, and their movement is limited, Israel says, for security reasons. The marathon course took runners along the West Bank separation barrier, into the Aida refugee camp, and under guard towers. Nader al-Masri won the marathon.

It's very hard, but I'm still proud of myself as a Palestinian,\" says al-Masri. In its third year, the marathon drew runners from all over the world, pilgrims of a sort making a journey to the holy land, not for religion, but for sport. \"It's an achievement,\" said Jamaani after finishing. \"Everyone looks for an achievement in life, and one of them was crossing this line, especially in the Palestine Marathon.\" For runners like Jamaani, the marathon is a statement made one step at a time.", "completion": "response:\n\nMore than 3,000 runners came to the West Bank .\n\"It means that you run for peace,\"  Sana Jamaani says ."}

Initial reports to police indicate that nine people, including four attackers, were killed after gunmen in military uniforms attacked the house of the former Somali parliament speaker and current president of the newly established southwest regional administration, said Col. Mahad Abdi, a Somali police officer. The attack began when a car bomb detonated at the gate of the state palace in Baidoa city, some 250 kilometers (155 miles) northwest of the capital, Mogadishu. Heavy gunfire broke out between Somali troops backed by Ethiopian forces inside the house of the regional president, Sharif Hassan Sheikh Aden. Explosions and gunfire were still going on over an hour after the initial assault, Abdi said. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack. A broadcast by the group's official radio station, Andulus, said that Al-Shabaab gunmen had entered the regional president's house and killed seven Ethiopian soldiers. The African Union's special representative for Somalia, Ambassador Maman S. Sidikou, condemned the attack, saying it had targeted troops who have worked to restore peace to Baidoa. \"I am deeply saddened by news of the attack in Baidoa this morning,\" he said in a statement released by AMISOM, the African Union mission to Somalia. Sidikou said he had also received reports of an attempted attack at a Mogadishu hotel Wednesday night. \"These are desperate attempts by Al-Shabaab to seek relevance, following the massive defeats they continue to suffer from the Somali National Army working together with AMISOM troops,\" he said. Al-Shabaab started with a goal of waging a war against the Somali government in an effort to implement a stricter form of Islamic law, or Sharia. It has since shifted focus to terrorist attacks in Somalia and beyond, even calling, in a video released last month, for attacks on shopping malls in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States.

But one in three Britons are regularly missing out on breakfast, a survey of 2,000 adults found. This can leave them tired and moody and lower the quality of their work, oat producer Flahavan's said. While two in three people are eating breakfast every day, the study found one in 13 never had a morning meal. Of those who are regularly missing out, two-thirds said they found it difficult to eat early in the morning, with other reasons including not considering breakfast important, not having time, preferring to stay in bed and having too many chores. The results showed more people were regularly missing the first meal of the day, compared with the 20 per cent who were skipping it three years ago. The time taken to eat the meal is also lower, now at just over nine minutes compared to almost ten in 2012. What the nation is eating for breakfast appears to be constantly changing, too. While cold cereals, porridge, fruit and toast remain the staple morning fuel for the majority of breakfasters, the fry up has now become an occasional treat with only 1.5 per cent of respondents saying they started the day with a traditional breakfast most days of the week. John Noonan, of Flahavan's, said: 'Our findings show a shift in the number of people having breakfast - the eating occasion renowned for being the most important meal of the day. Just 1.5 per cent of people have a traditional fried breakfast before work every morning, a study found . 'It's no secret that we all need a good breakfast to get the day off to a good start. 'And while it's great to see that people are becoming more health-conscious with their breakfast choices - opting for porridge and healthy cereals - the number of people who are regularly going without breakfast is certainly surprising, particularly given that making a nutritious, tasty breakfast takes no time at all. 'We know that people are time-pressured, particularly from Monday to Friday, but skipping breakfast only results in people feeling worse in the long-run, as they don't have enough energy to power them through the day.'", "completion": "response:\n\nOne in 13 people never eat breakfast, a study of 2,000 Britons found .\nA third of adults regularly skip the morning meal as they run out of time .\nThis can leave them tired and moody and can lower quality of their work .\nJust 1.5 per cent of people have a traditional fried breakfast every day ."}

The 200lb week-old newborn was captured collapsing under its own weight as it struggled to walk beside its mother at the Samburu National Park in Kenya. Photographed by Margot Raggett, the images show the elephant mother patiently wandering beside its baby as it repeatedly wobbles and collapses while learning to walk. Scroll down for video .

Unable to correct itself, the calf then collapses into a heap on the ground . It then gives up completely, flopping onto its side in the dry riverbank while its mother looks on . She said: 'Young elephants are one of my favourite species to photograph, they are so adorable. 'If they are not playing and being mischievous they are acting like clowns while trying to find their feet. 'This youngster completely lost its footing in the dry riverbed and then when it finally struggled to its feet proceeded to examine one of its feet like it was to blame for it falling over.' She added: 'In the meantime the mother just carried on patiently grazing, though you could see she was keeping a watch on the youngster out of the corner of her eye'. Adult elephants take a great deal of care of calves, helping them climb steep banks and protecting them from predators. If a calf loses its mother for some reason other female in the group will take care of it.

The Japanese artefacts – a wooden plaque and replica school textbook – went missing from the Kaetsu Educational and Cultural Centre last Saturday as it hosted a Japan Day celebration. The replicas were loaned to the university from a museum in Japan, marking the first time they had ever been taken out of the country. Punt boats carry tourists on the river Cam past King's College at Cambridge University . Staff launched a search after they noticed the precious objects were missing. They eventually found the tourist who had mistaken the artefacts for souvenirs and returned them with an apology. University officials said the textbook is a replica of those used in Japanese schools during World War II. During the war residents of the island of Okinawa – a key battleground for Japanese and American forces – were forced to speak the Japanese language the rest of the country used, rather than their own dialect, for the purposes of unification. The Japanese artefacts were taken by a tourist during a Japan Day celebration at Cambridge University . As punishment, those who spoke their native tongue were forced to wear the wooden plaque around their neck. The artefacts are now being returned to the Peace Memorial Museum in Okinawa. Peter Roberts-Taira, the education centre's director, said he was relieved when he found out that the artefacts had been recovered. He said: ‘It's the first time these items have ever been out of Japan, so the museums themselves were taking a risk. University officials said they located the tourist and the artefacts were returned with an apology (file photo) ‘It was Saturday, right at the very end of the day when everyone was packing away that we realised they had gone. ‘One was a wooden plaque with some Japanese on it, the other was a maths book which children had in their classrooms.’ He added: ‘You wouldn't know they were valuable to look at, so maybe somebody just though they could take them. ‘The message went out wider to people who asked their friends, and apparently they discovered a friend of a friend had thought those things were possible to take away as souvenirs. ‘They are irreplaceable, if they are gone, they are gone forever.

Having top-scored in MCC's t20 defeat to Sussex on Friday, Cook could not replicate his form as he was trapped lbw by Ryan Sidebottom, with his side all out for 221 in their first innings.

Alastair Cook was dismissed for three on day one of the champion county match in Abu Dhabi . Yorkshire's Ryan Sidebottom celebrates after trapping Cook lbw for just three runs . Cook will now be able to see at the closest of quarters whether or not Lyth has what it takes to occupy that spot in the wake of his first call-up earlier this week. Sidebottom removed Nick Compton - someone who has partnered Cook in Tests - with the first ball of the match as the MCC captain edged a delivery into Jonny Bairstow's gloves. Cook soon followed Compton back into the pavilion before Michael Carberry and James Hildreth steadied the ship. James Hildreth scored 89 to help MCC up to a score of 221 in their first innings in Abu Dhabi . Adam Lyth was unbeaten on 53 as Yorkshire closed day one on 82 for two in response . The duo put on 74 for the third wicket before Carberry fell for 36, but Hildreth pushed on and made 89 before Tim Bresnan got him out lbw after lunch.

Research: The study by Nottingham Trent University (above) found that as a herd animal, horses prefer to be in groups and stables prevent them interacting with their neighbours . Equine welfare expert Kelly Yarnell told the Daily Telegraph: ‘To the human eye, the stable appears safe and inviting and is based on the belief of what the horse finds comfortable. ‘However, for a social animal that spends most of its time in close contact with other horses, the isolation brought about by single housing could activate an equine stress response.’ She said equine welfare would be improved by shared housing. In the wild, horses live in herds that move over up to 30 sq miles while domestic horses often spend most of the day inside. Lee Hackett, director of equine policy at The British Horse Society, said the study should change the way we keep horses. He said: ‘It is fairly obvious that keeping any animal in a domestic setting could potentially compromise it, whether that be a hamster in a cage or a lion in a zoo.'", "completion": "response:\n\nStables prevent horses interacting with their neighbours, scientists say .\nIsolated animals suffer higher stress levels and become harder to manage .\nNottingham Trent University study shows horses are happiest in paddock ."}

As many as 47 per cent of Britons would be keen to head off on a fitness holiday, the poll by foreign exchange company Travelex showed. More than a third (34 per cent) booking health holidays are prepared to spend £500 or more on a trip, with more than half reckoning they will get better deals on fitness activities abroad than at home. Model Gisele Bundchen is a keen advocate of maintaining her exercise routine on holiday . TOWIE's Lucy Mecklenburgh has developed a strict fitness regime that centres on hard work and dedication . With a number of celebrities advocating exercise while on holiday, it seems the old adage of a break involving lounging around may be outdated. Model Gisele Bundchen has shared with her Instagram followers a series of photos of her exercising and performing yoga on the beach, and other stars such as Kelly Brook and TOWIE'S Lucy Mecklenburgh are similarly as strict with their fitness routines. Naked yoga, bootcamps and Nordic Walking are among the activities Britons have attempted, with 30 per cent of those keen on a health holiday seeing it as a chance to tone up and 23 per cent to lose weight. Also, 21 per cent wanted to learn a new skill while 17 per cent wanted to concentrate purely on their well-being. In contrast, boozy group trips only appealed to five per cent of the 2,000 people polled. Pop singer Beyonce (left) and model Miranda Kerr practise some yoga while on holiday .

The three-inch tall cup with a chipped rim was bought by accident by a lucky dealer who snapped up a tray-load of pieces because he liked another item on it. After retaining the item of porcelain he took the rest to an auctioneer who immediately spotted the potential of the blue and white beaker.

But interest in the item took off as did the bidding and it eventually went under the hammer for £37,000. With fees added on the British buyer paid £44,400 for it.

On the bottom of the vessel is a seal mark of a crown and trident and only 20 pieces of Chelsea porcelain contained this mark. Chris Large, of auctioneers Peter Wilson of Nantwhich, Cheshire, said: 'Chelsea porcelain was at the top of the tree in terms of quality and was comparable to Meissen. Estimate: Cautious auctioneers at Peter Wilson valued the incredibly rare beaker at between £100 and £200 . 'The beaker would have been used for practical purposes back in the day. It was a status symbol, a bit like getting out your best crystal while entertaining today. 'A local dealer bought it in a tray-lot of items. He wanted something else on that tray and gave us the rest. 'I recognised as very early Chelsea porcelain but the vendor wasn't convinced that it was.

The elixir on every fashionista's lips was bone broth, which is being sold by the cup from a hip new Manhattan shop. Aficionados claim that it is rich in amino acids - the building blocks of protein - calcium and collagen, and that drinking it will do everything from warding off illnesses to curing joint pain, and giving you healthy skin, nails and hair. And at just 86 calories per cup, it's a very slimming lunch option. It's catching on here, too - celebrity chefs Jasmine and Melissa Hemsley, whose healthy cookbook The Art of Eating Well knocked Jamie Oliver and Mary Berry off the top of the Amazon charts, advocate ladlefuls of bone broth in everything from stews to scrambled eggs. Making it couldn't be easier: simply add 2-3kg of bones from any beef, lamb or chicken carcass to a pan of water with a couple of onions, leeks, carrots and celery sticks. Add a tablespoon of peppercorns, a bay leaf and a dash of cider vinegar and simmer for up to 24 hours. It may sound like old-fashioned stock, but fans claim bone broth is different because it simmers for eight hours longer, which helps break down the protein you get from the bones. But Sian Porter, spokesman for the British Dietetic Association, isn't convinced. 'Bone broth does contain nutrients, minerals and vitamins, but in pretty low quantities. You'd get far more goodness from just eating meat.' However, she says, making your own stock is 'certainly better than buying it in a cube, as you can control what goes in it'. Bone broths have traditionally been prescribed for colds, flu and digestive health, says Laura Tilt, a registered dietitian. 'The main protein in bone broth is gelatine. Gelatine supplements have been shown to improve pain and stiffness in osteoarthritis sufferers, but whether you get the same benefits from broth is unclear.' So is bone broth a magic bullet for superhuman health and supermodel looks? Probably not. But is it much better for you than a supermarket-bought stock cube? Almost certainly.", "completion": "response:\n\nNew York Fashion Week models were drinking bone broth .\nAficionados claim that it is rich in amino acids, calcium and collagen .\nAnd at just 86 calories per cup, it's a very slimming lunch option ."}

Dr Lindsey Doe, a blogger under the name 'Doe Eyes' who specializes in sexual harassment, dedicated her latest clip to the teenager who has approached her daughter at school, on the bus, and with poems - despite multiple rejections. In a post titled Dear Boy Who Likes My Daughter, that has amassed more than 250,000 views, Doe explains that pursuing somebody without consent is harassment. Instead, she advises, he should write about his feelings in a diary. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'Leave her alone': Dr Lindsey Doe directed a message to the boy who keeps asking out her daughter . Doe, who used to work for the University of Montana, says: 'I don’t like how you treat [my daughter.] Are you confused? You probably picked up messages from society about how when you want something, you have to \"try harder, go at it, do whatever you can to get it. Don’t give up!\" 'Maybe it’s for this reason that you repeatedly ask my daughter out. In the halls, on the bus, and you write her poems.' For his own understanding, she explains the appropriate way to act after asking a girl out. If she says 'I don't know', give her space. 'Maybe' prompts a conversation about her feelings of uncertainty. Only in the instance that she says 'ask me again later' should he ask again - but much later. Doe, who blogs on YouTube as 'Doe Eyes', explains that he is harassing her daughter with his requests . If he wants to express his feelings, she explains, he should write a diary or speak to a trusted friend . But her daughter, she says, has simply responded: 'no thanks', 'stop asking me', and 'no, no go away'. 'Person Who Likes My Daughter, this goes for all aspects of your life,' Doe says. 'If someone tells you \"no\" in any way and you ask again, it's not cool, it's not attractive, it's not respectful, it's harassment. 'My daughter has the right to change her mind and the ability to let you know if she does. 'Until then I expect that you do not ask her out, do not suggest a relationship, do not talk to her about her discomfort with you pursuing her. Leave her alone.'", "completion": "response:\n\nDr Lindsey Doe speaks directly to boy who keeps approaching daughter .\nShe explains that pursuing her is harassment and he should stop .\nInstead, he could write a diary about his feelings or talk to a friend .\nVideo uploaded to YouTube has amassed more than 250,000 views ."}

Police say Nowsch shot Tammy Meyers, 44, in front of her home after the car he was riding in followed her home February 12.

A van driver who tried to smuggle £8million worth of liquid amphetamine in wine bottles has been jailed for five years. Lee Dyer, 40, from St Helens, Merseyside was stopped by Border Force officers at the Channel Tunnel terminal in Coquelles, France last May and told them he had been in Belgium doing plastering and collecting solar panels. Officers found boxes containing more than 100 wine bottles in the back of Dyer's van, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said. The substance inside the bottles appeared oily and later checks showed the liquid tested positive for amphetamine. Dyer was arrested and checks on the van showed it had been hired in Warrington, with Dyer supplying the hire company with a false address. For previous trips he had also used hired vehicles, taking them abroad illegally. Forensic tests on the 99 kilos of concentrated liquid amphetamine in the wine bottles found that there was enough to have produced almost three quarters of a tonne at street-level purity, with a potential street value of almost £8million. Last month, Dyer admitted importing controlling drugs and he was today sentenced at Canterbury Crown Court.

Jim loves the rugby. Truth be told, if Ireland versus England captured his attention, he might even have delayed changing channels until it was over.

Football Association chairman Greg Dyke would like to see the number of home-grown players in top-flight squads increased from eight to 12, a move he feels will benefit the national team. Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore claims clubs were told by Dyke at a meeting on Thursday that the FA could not impose the change. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has spoken out against a quota-based system for home grown players . And Wenger believes those changes will not benefit the league or the national team. In an interview with beIN Sports, Wenger said: 'I believe that we are in the world of competition. Competition means who of you or me is the best one. We have to accept that. 'That means as well that the rules of the game must be structured to favour the best. Or we are not in a competition anymore. The Arsenal boss, on the bench at Newcastle before the international break, is against Greg Dyke's proposals . 'So we can say one of two things - we protect the mediocre or we produce the best players.' Wenger warned that similar schemes in other countries had led to young players becoming 'professional subs', not enhancing their development but downgrading the league standard. 'I give you two examples, he said. 'In Yugoslavia in the past they decided you had to play three players on the team sheet who were under 21. What happened? They became professional subs. It happened in France, too. FA chairman Greg Dyke would like to see at least 12 home-grown players in top-flight squads .

The sports broadcaster, 44, used a step-counting machine as she went on a diet – and lost an impressive 20lb in under three months. Miss Balding said the weight loss had boosted her self-esteem. Scroll down for video . Sports broadcaster Clare Balding (pictured with partner Alice Arnold earlier this week) used a step-counting machine and went on a diet – and lost an impressive 20lb in under three months . ‘I’m more confident about my body now. I just think, “Get on with it, no one’s looking.” 'I’m less conscious of the things that don’t matter so much,’ she said. In an interview with Woman & Home magazine, out on Thursday, she revealed her partner Alice Arnold, 52, had her reservations about the weight loss. ‘But when she saw me in it she thought I looked good. And I felt great,’ she added. Miss Balding’s glamorous new look makes a change from the jeans and loose-fitting blouses she is more often seen wearing to present programmes such as Channel 4’s racing coverage. Miss Balding back in 2012 before her health kick which sees her regularly exercise and diet, and right, on the cover of Woman & Home . And it highlights just how much her shape has changed in recent years, after a bet with her mother spurred on to get in shape. She had caught sight of herself looking ‘as if I’d been blown up with a bicycle pump’, she once said, on a TV monitor at the Newmarket races in 2013. Miss Balding was spurred to get in shape after a bet with her mother, offering £100 per pound of weight shed to whoever lost the most. She used a Jawbone fitness band to count her steps, which she said made ‘a massive difference to my life’. She walked 10,000 steps per day, monitored by a calorie-counting app, and went on a diet – although she has admitted not sticking to the 1,200 calorie limit. And the result was a 20lb weight loss in the space of two-and-a-half months. Tomorrow Miss Balding’s new entertainment and sport chat show begins on BBC2. The channel acquired the rights from BT Sport and the programme will be screened on both channels.", "completion": "response:\n\nPresenter Clare Balding, 44, has shed 20lb in just two and half months .\nSports broadcaster used step-counter and went on 1,200-calorie a day diet .\nShe says it has boosted her self-esteem and made her feel more confident ."}

The owner of Chelsea Football Club and his family should be hit by new Western sanctions aimed at hurting the strongman's regime and those who propped it up, claimed Alexei Navalny. He called for the same curbs on leading Arsenal FC shareholder, Alisher Usmanov, in a bid to force the Kremlin's hand over Ukraine. Britain should ban major Russian tycoons like Roman Abramovich from London, demanded Vladimir Putin's most prominent foe, Alexei Navalny (pictured) These Russian moneymen are seen as close to strongman Putin, but sanctions so far have not hit them directly. Navalny, released from a short jail sentence in Moscow this week, is seeking to inspire the Russian opposition after the brutal murder of fellow Putin foe Boris Nemtsov in the shadow of the Kremlin. 'You can draw up a blacklist of about 1,000 people who will no longer be allowed entry into Western countries, and you can do it quietly, without any big announcement,' the anti-corruption blogger and lawyer told The Financial Times. Navalny believes that if tycoons such as Abramovich (pictured) can't get to their London residences, it will put pressure on Moscow to pull out of Ukraine . 'Usmanov, Abramovich, and their families - if they can't get to their residences in London or in Switzerland, that will make a difference.' It was essential to hit the wealthy clans who help Putin control Russia, he said. To weaken Putin's resolve over Ukraine, he warned the West: 'You have to hit the propagandists of war, the ones who finance the war.' This was the only way to stop him, he said. Russian oligarchs 'all hate him but they feel they can't but remain silent'. 'A few years ago, we thought this was just nepotism, but now we realise that this is long-term planning: he is installing dynastic rule,' he said. Some wealthy tycoons untouched by sanctions backed Putin to the hilt yet flew to the West to enjoy weekends. He said of the slain Nemtsov that he was a 'communicator' who was 'not afraid'. Navalny added: 'He could bring together everyone in the opposition from liberals to the far left, but he would also talk to people inside the system, like the Communists, who did not accept his views but were open to dialogue with him.' With Nemtsov now dead, Navalny is seen as Russia's most effective and charismatic opposition campaigner.", "completion": "response:\n\nAlexei Navalny says if tycoons can't get to London, it will pressure Moscow .\nSeveral influential Russian tycoons have bases in the British capital .\nNavalny is seen as Russia's most effective  opposition campaigner .\nHe is seeking to inspire the Russian opposition after murder of Nemtsov ."}

Scientists discovered that patients who listened to experts of Mozart had enhanced gene activity in the brain in areas including memory and learning. Meanwhile, the music also affected the activity of a risk gene connected to Parkinson's disease. Classical music can help slow down the onset of dementia by enhancing gene activity in the brain, new research has found . The Finnish researchers found the changed activity was only present in 'musically-experienced' patients, who listened to music regularly, suggesting the importance of familiarity with music. For the study, participants were asked to listen to Mozart's violin concert No 3, G-major, K.216, a piece that lasts 20 minutes. The experiment was carried out on both musically experienced and inexperienced participants. The research involved participants listening to Mozart (pictured) for 20 minutes . The study showed that genes were enhanced in those deemed 'musically experienced' in areas such as dopamine secretion, which is when a neurohormone is released in the brain, synaptic neurotransmission, which is how neurons receive information, and learning and memory. Meanwhile, the music appeared to down-regulate genes associated with neuro-degeneration, which is the progressive loss of the structure or function of neurons. The researchers said several of the up-regulated genes were ones which are responsible for song learning and singing in songbirds. This suggests a common evolutionary background of sound perception across different species, they said. One of the most affected genes in this area was synuclein-alpha (SNCA), which is also a known risk gene for Parkinson's disease. Study leader Doctor Irma Jarvela, of Helsinki University, said: 'The up-regulation of several genes that are known to be responsible for song learning and singing in songbirds suggest a shared evolutionary background of sound perception between vocalizing birds and humans.' He added: 'The effect was only detectable in musically experienced participants, suggesting the importance of familiarity and experience in mediating music-induced effects.' Dr Jarvela added that the findingscould give give further insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying music therapy. The effects of this are still largely unknown.", "completion": "response:\n\nResearch saw patients listen to Mozart's violin concert No 3 for 20 minutes .\nThe 'musically-experienced' people had enhanced gene activity, it found .\nMusic also affected risk gene synuclein-alpha, connected to Parkinson's ."}

Holmes, 27, is charged as the sole gunman who stormed a crowded movie theater at a midnight showing of \"The Dark Knight Rises\" in Aurora, Colorado, and opened fire, killing 12 people and wounding 58 more in July 2012. When the trial began in January, some 9,000 potential jurors were summoned, and jury selection was expected then to continue until May or June, when the trial would finally start. The jury selection process, however, appears to be moving faster than expected, according to court spokesman Rob McCallum. In January, Judge Carlos A.

Holmes, a one-time neuroscience doctoral student, faces 166 counts, including murder and attempted murder charges. Holmes has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. If convicted of the most serious charges, he could face a death sentence. Prosecutors have charged in court that Holmes \"intended to kill them all,\" referring to patrons in the crowded cinema watching the Batman film \"The Dark Knight Rises.\" Holmes colored his hair a comic-book red and told police he was \"The Joker\" upon arrest after the mass killing. Holmes was heavily armed and \"dressed head-to-toe in protective gear,\" authorities said. He wore black contact lenses to conceal his eyes. His AR-15 jammed during the shooting, police said, and they arrested him in the parking lot. The trial itself could last four months.

A four-storey townhouse in the exclusive London area now sells for £40million, while even a flat in the cheapest Monopoly area of Whitechapel has gone for nearly £5million. In light of such ludicrous prices, one estate agent has now re-imagined the classic board game – set in desirable English market towns.

The coalition will again push for a mandatory five-year minimum sentences for traffickers by tabling legislation already rejected by the Senate in February. The prime minister on Sunday called on Labor to support the tough new gun laws, saying it was crucial to cracking down on criminals involved in the illegal firearms trade. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott (L) and Attorney General George Brandis (R) at the Australian Federal Police Headquarters . 'I say to Bill Shorten and the Labor Party, if you're fair dinkum about protecting our community from gun crime you should support these mandatory minimum sentences for people who traffic in illegal firearms,' he told reporters in Sydney. Labor voted against the measures earlier this year, citing an opposition to mandatory sentences. But Mr Abbott said Labor had supported mandatory minimum sentencing for people smugglers when it was in government, and should back its gun trafficking legislation. 'The Labor Party to its credit has a fair record in this parliament on national security,' he said. There are an estimated 250,000 illegal firearms in Australia . 'I don't believe you can properly separate out this crackdown on illegal trafficking in firearms from our overall national security effort.' But shadow attorney general Mark Dreyfus ruled out support for the measure, saying heavy penalties already existed for firearms trafficking. 'There is no evidence that mandatory minimum sentences work as a deterrent,' Mr Dreyfus said. Greens' senator Penny Wright said she was she did not believe tougher gun sentences would make Australia a safer place. The coalition will again push for a mandatory five-year minimum sentences for traffickers by tabling legislation already rejected by the Senate in February . 'Tougher sentencing for trafficking is not the way to address gun crime in Australia,' she said. 'While more certainly needs to be done to stop illegal imports, many illicit firearms are actually stolen from legitimate sources or taken from the 'grey market', including the gun used in the Sydney siege.

The clip features  baby Ramsey whining while attempting to speak, much to the delight of Texan owner Kayla Cagnola, who holds the puppy in her arms.

Reacting to a howl, the puppy continues communicating frenetically before coming face to face with another dog – seemingly as baffled as anyone else as to what Ramsey is trying to say. According to the Huffington Post, the dog was reacting to being told off after eating her roommate’s dog food. There are several theories as to how dog-human communication has evolved over the years. Looking around the room, the puppy begins its high-pitched yapping while struggling to break free . Some believe that communicative skills of dogs arose from the social behaviours of ancestral, group-living wolves. While others believe that domesticated dogs have either evolved to mimic the behaviours of humans or that they have been selectively bred to be tame and collaborative. As for howling, dogs do this for a range of reasons including: locating other pack members, keeping strangers away, or calling the pack for hunting. The dog's owner Kayla Cagnola laughs hysterically while trying to interpret what puppy Ramsey is trying to say . Dog's may also howl when they are suffering from separation anxiety as a way of communicating with owners and other dogs from a distance. Whether these apply to Ramsey – who appears to just like making high-pitched noise – however remains to be seen. So far the original video has been viewed over three million times on YouTube.

The plan allows the first-term U.S. senator, who's running for re-election and making a likely bid for president, to get around a Kentucky law that prohibits candidates from appearing on the same ballot twice. Rand Paul searches for green light on caucus proposal . After Paul met with the party's 54-member executive committee in Bowling Green for a two-hour session, the group voted unanimously to appoint a smaller committee that would decide the rules and regulations of how a caucus would be held. The final vote would come in August when a larger gathering of the Kentucky GOP is scheduled to meet and hear a more detailed plan from the task force. \"We thank the members of RPK for their unanimous support and look forward to continuing this process,\" said Paul's top adviser, Doug Stafford, in a statement. Kentucky law allows the state party to determine the details of its presidential preference vote, but not the primary for other elected offices in the state. In other words, Paul's name for his Senate re-election bid would still remain on the May 2016 primary ballot, but the presidential vote would likely move up earlier in the year to March. The senator appeared at the meeting to address some concerns about a caucus, namely the increased cost, as well as the lower voter turnout typically associated with caucuses. He has pledged to raise money through his donor network to help offset the costs, and proponents of the caucus argue that the significant media attention expected and Kentucky's earlier placement in the nominating calendar would spur just as much turnout. Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, a Democrat, issued a scathing statement Saturday, saying a Republican caucus next year \"could create potential chaos in our electoral process\" and promised to \"monitor the situation\" in the coming months. \"In the meantime, I call on the Republican Party of Kentucky to provide details on how all their voters would be able to participate and how the party intends to uphold the integrity of the process,\" she said.", "completion": "response:\n\nRand Paul wants his hat in ring for both president and Senate .\nKentucky GOP moves toward creating caucus to allow that scenario .\nDemocratic state official criticizes move ."}

'Sometimes I get the feeling that it seems we can't play together,' Iniesta told Marca. Andres Iniesta and Xavi (right) have had a long, successful career together in Barcelona's first team . Despite their incredible careers, Iniesta (left) says that he sometimes struggles to play alongside Xavi .

At 30 and 35 respectively, Iniesta and Xavi have had long and illustrious careers at the Nou Camp, collecting trophy after trophy under a number of different managers.

Iniesta, at the age of 30, impressed in the midfield on Sunday in the Barcelona midfield against Rayo Vallecano . But together they have remained, and when Barcelona took to the field to face Rayo Vallecano on Sunday, there they were in the midfield once more. Barcelona trounced Rayo Vallecano 6-1 to take them top of La Liga for the first time since October.

Iniesta though, is still focused on the matches to come. Eibar in the league, Manchester City in the Champions League, and then a Clasico to potentially decide the title. 'More important than being at the top or not is the general feeling of the team after the game we just played,' Iniesta continued. 'We feel good and have to continue along that line.

A young mother has told how her first holiday away with her son was ruined after she discovered blood splattered on her chalet windows and mould throughout. Tierney Hinde, 28, from Dartford, Kent, was disgusted with the state of her Pontins apartment, with the nightmare starting when she discovered the dirty bed linen. Things got worse when she was offered a different room on a higher floor with blood-spattered windows at the resort in Camber, East Sussex. 'It was supposed to be the first trip with my son but it was a farce that's all I can say,' said Ms Hinde. 'I nearly cried. I don't really get like that but it was just a complete waste of time.' She chose Pontins over other resorts because the locks on the doors would provide security for autistic son Presley, four, who has a tendency to wander off. The windows were cleaned off but Tierney was still unhappy because being higher up meant more danger for Presley. As she predicted the youngster, who has poor co-ordination, fell down the landing steps, although no fault has been attributed to Pontins for this. Tierney was also disappointed by the lack of activities available for Presley. She said: 'Pontins should be getting involved with all of the kids and it wasn't like that at all. 'All he wanted to do was go towards the arcades because there was nothing else for him. 'I went there when I was 15 and nothing had changed since then and they were supposed to have had a rebirth in 2011.' Tierney Hinde became upset after discovering the bed linen was filthy in her Pontins chalet . The mould in the bathroom added to the young mum's worry, and she requested to move rooms . Tierney was so upset that she gave up on her week-long trip, which cost £500, after three days. She has since been offered 50 per cent off vouchers and VIP treatment on her next stay, but refuses to step foot in the resort again. MailOnline Travel has contacted Pontins, and is awaiting comment.

Officials said Tribhuvan International would reopen at 10 a.m. local time Saturday as preparations to move the plane continue. \"We do not know now if it will take longer than then to move the plane,\" Purna Chudal, manager of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, told CNN. More then 160 flights have been canceled since Wednesday's incident, leaving more than 24,000 passengers stranded as officials struggle to remove the immobile Airbus A330 off the runway, Chudal said. The timing of the incident is problematic for Nepal's tourism industry, which is gearing up for the 2015 climbing season. Foreigners heading to Mount Everest and other nearby peaks in the Himalayan Mountains transit through the airport. The authority initially said it would reopen the airport at 10 a.m. Friday, later revising that to 5 p.m., but workers were unable to remove the aircraft by that time. They were able to lift the plane's nose -- originally pitched down -- and change its tires. The main challenge now is to push the grass-grounded plane back onto the runway. Officials say the area under the plane needs to be firmed up -- a process that involves digging into the ground and filling it with gravel -- before push back can commence. The Turkish Airways incident didn't result in any major injuries but the plane has remained aground as Nepal doesn't have the necessary equipment to move it. Cargo planes were unable to fly in heavy-duty machinery because there was nowhere to land. A specialized aircraft carrying experts and aircraft removal equipment from India reportedly arrived on Thursday.

The corpses, some of them beheaded, were found in a shallow mass grave under a bridge just outside the Nigerian town of Damasak, near the border with Niger, the sources said. Troops from Niger and Chad took back the town from Boko Haram last week during a joint operation, the security sources said. Damasak is in Borno, one of several northern states inhabited by the Islamist militant group. Borno is in the northeast corner of Nigeria and borders Niger, Chad and Cameroon. Boko Haram has terrorized northern Nigeria regularly since 2009, attacking police, schools, churches, mosques and civilians. It has kidnapped students, including more than 200 schoolgirls who were abducted in April 2014 and remain missing. The group, its naming meaning \"Western education is forbidden,\" has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of Sharia law across Nigeria. Journalist Aminu Abubakar reported from Kano, Nigeria.

A longtime science teacher in Ohio has been reprimanded for failing to report a student who allegedly took a bottle of illegal liquor he had produced to class. Jennifer Thompson, 52, who has taught at Riverside middle school in De Graff for more than 20 years, reportedly tipped the moonshine down the drain when she was shown it but did not alert authorities. According to Dayton Daily News, she was issued with a formal warning letter as a result, while the pupil in question was suspended from school. Thompson apparently knew the 13-year-old boy and another 14-year-old had created a still and were starting to produce alcohol. While she warned the duo it could be 'dangerous', investigators claim the tutor took no strict action to stop the operation. In January, a report from the Logan County Sheriff says the student brought some of the liquor to show in science class. Thompson disposed of it instead of alerting the principle. Under Ohio law, the illegal manufacture of moonshine is considered a first-degree misdemeanor - carrying the same charges as crimes including petty theft or assault. It is unclear whether the boy who took the moonshine to class will face juvenile delinquency charges in the case. Wrong move: The science teacher reportedly tipped the alcohol down the drain when she was shown it but did not alert authorities . Scene of the incident: An aerial shot of Riverside Local Schools School in Ohio . In the meantime he is said to be awaiting an expulsion hearing led by Riverside Schools.

Any accident raises questions, and the National Transportation Safety Board is sending people to New York's LaGuardia Airport to investigate. Although the cause of the crash is not yet clear, officials will no doubt be looking at the conditions on the runway. Was it cleared and ready? Did the pilot have all relevant information? CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo breaks down the responsibilities around runways. \"There are a couple of things that airports have to do,\" she said. \"The airport has to go out and measure whether the airport runways have friction, meaning when those tires touch down that they will have some contact with the runway.\" That information is then relayed to the air traffic control tower, according to Schiavo. \"As to whether the runways are slippery, that is breaking action, and the airport gets that from the reports of previous pilots,\" she said. Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Executive Director Patrick Foye told reporters that the runway in question had been plowed shortly before the incident. Pilots on previous planes reported \"good braking action,\" he said. Just minutes after the Delta plane landed, all of LaGuardia Arport shut down to air traffic. One runway reopened at 2 p.m. ET. The other remained closed. Miles O'Brien, another CNN aviation analyst, highlights how difficult it is to understand all the elements in play. \"The wind was changing. The temperatures were changing. It was moving from rain to freezing rain, ultimately into snow.

The 22-seater Gulfstream II plane, valued at $4.5million, is stuck on the tarmac at Miami Executive airport while its new owners do battle in court. Jose Avelino Goncalves, 49, a Venezuelan, has been accused making off with the plane after holding back more than $3million of what he agreed to pay a business partner for it. Bin grounded: This plane, which used to belong to Osama bin Laden's family, has been grounded in Miami amid a legal dispute between subsequent owners . Suspect: Jose Goncalves, 45, is accused of agreeing to buy the plane then not paying up. It was owned by the family of Osama bin Laden (right) until 1980 . Officers in Miami-Dade county have taken custody of the corporate vehicle, the Miami Herald reported. The Gulfstream II is a staple of international luxury travel, which rich businessmen often kit out with lavish interiors. Ownership records show that the plane belonged to the billionaire Bin Laden clan until 1980. At that point, Osama is thought to have just graduated from university in Saudi Arabia, and was still years away from founding al-Qaeda. His elder half-brother, Salem bin Laden, was then head of the family, which made its fortune from oil.

The jet was recently owned by Luis Enrique Nuñez-Villanueva, a former business partner of Goncalves, who is now suing him over it. State prosecutors, who are also trying Goncalves on fraud and theft charges, say he agreed to buy the plane from Nuñez-Villanueva for $4.5million. Goncalves allegedly agreed to pay $1.5million up-front for it, and make monthly payments of $500,000 until the balance was covered. But it is claimed he only ever paid $829,196. Goncalves's lawyers, however, have characterized the spat as a 'misunderstanding' and say Nuñez- Villanueva took the $829,196 unlawfully to buy himself a helicopter.

On nightshifts at his police station, Superintendent Paul Clements is used to dealing with the usual collection of drunks and other ne’er do wells. But he was surprised when three Romanian children arrived at the central London police station at 3am and said they were 130 miles from home. The children, aged 12, 14 and 17, told officers they lived with their parents in Nottingham and then asked for a taxi home and a meal from McDonalds. Instead, officers bought the youngsters sandwiches from a nearby petrol station and called social services to care for them.

New owner Scott Adelman bought the property at a knockdown price of just $70,000 because the land it was built on was being turned into a flood diversion. A million-dollar, five bedroom mansion has been successfully transplanted 14 miles from Fargo to Horace in North Dakota . Moving the 4,500-square-foot, 218-tonne home required four moving companies, a 23-axel truck, a slew of permits and help from dozens of people including police officers and electricians . 'It's quite the project to just get it moved,' new owner Scott Adelman told KVLY. He said the most challenging part of the process has been securing all the permits required, especially because he wanted to take the property across the interstate bridge. That required the Department of Transportation as well as the city of Fargo, Stanley Township, and Horace. He also had to coordinate with other contractors including sign companies, street light companies and power companies. It took two days to move the house as it crawled along the interstate at speeds of about 5 mph. Now that it has reached its destination, Adelman has a crew of 15 people ready to rebuild the property so he can have it back on the market in just five weeks. 'We will have to put the foundation underneath it and piece it back together,' said Adelman. 'It's a project, but the majority of the house obviously, stays intact.' He estimates that it will take a week for the concrete to set and then the house will be set on top. Then the plumbing and electric will next to set up before a new family can move in. Adelman, who owns a company that specializes in relocating and 'recycling' homes, intends to list the property at around $700,000.

However, for those seeking perfection - a runny yolk - every time, help might soon be at hand. The New Egg Company, based in Nottingham, has come up with the idea of a pre-cooked egg, which requires little more than five minutes of reheating. The downside? At £1.79 per pack, it'll cost around fives times the price of a standard egg. Eggstraordinary: The Yowk is a pre-cooked egg that promises the ideal yolk every time and even comes with soldiers, salt and a spoon . Marketed as the Yowk - 'simple dippy goodness', the pasteurised egg arrives in a plastic pot having already been cooked in its shell using the 'sous vide' method favoured by many top chefs - essentially the modern equivalent of boiling in the bag. The pot lid doubles up as an egg cup, say the makers and even comes with breadsticks, salt and a spoon to eat it with. The diner simply adds boiling water to the pot and leaves it for five minutes with a perfect, runny yolk guaranteed. This new method may seem no quicker than the traditional way to boil an egg; by immersing it in a pan of water and boiling it for around four minutes. However,  it could extract the potential for arguments over the best way to boil an egg. And the egg overflowth...a runny yolk is many people's idea of egg heaven . Foolproof? The Yowk uses the sous vide method, favoured by top chefs, to produce the perfect yolk . Kitchens can be a hotbed of tension as home cooks dispute the perfect amount of time an egg should boil for, whether eggs should be kept in a fridge or at room temperature; placed in cold water and then boiled; or just in boiling water. New Egg Company managing director Ian Hetherington told trade journal The Grocer that the product was the result of improving on an earlier prototype called 'the Dippy Egg' back in 2013. He said: 'It didn't take off the first time but the concept was still in its infancy. 'We have undertaken a lot more testing to get the product right.' The product is to be unveiled at the International Food Event trade show later this month before aiming to be listed in supermarkets and possibly food and drink outlets in May. A coffee chain has already expressed interest in selling it, along with some retailers, Hetherington told The Grocer.", "completion": "response:\n\nThe Yowk pre-cooked egg simply needs reheating for five minutes to achieve the perfect yolk, say the makers .\nPacks will retail at £1.79 each and come complete with an egg cup, spoon, soldier-style breadsticks and salt .\nThe product looks likely to hit supermarket shelves in May ."}

The disclosure came when extracts of his new autobiography were printed in a German magazine. 'I had a relationship with another woman,' said Schmidt, who lost his wife Loki five years ago. Schmidt, 96, revealed his deepest personal secret in his book What I Still Want To Say, which is being serialised by the magazine Stern. He would not reveal the identity of his mistress nor how long the affair lasted. Former German Chancellor Helmut Schimdt  has admitted to having an affair during his 68-year marriage to Loki (pictured, above, with her husband in 2009) sometime in the late 60s or early 70s . 'It was at the end of the 60s or the beginning of the 70s,' he said, adding that his wife found out about it. He said she realised how 'close' it was and offered to leave him. 'I told her that was a totally fallacious idea,' he added. According to Stern, the woman was a colleague in the social democrat party which he led. He remained in contact with her 'for a long while' after the break up and attended her funeral two years ago.

Mr Johnston is said to have left her side as he did not want to be 'busted' for having drugs in his possession, according to the NZ Herald.

These unanswered questions are primarily due to Mr Johnston refusing to disclose what he was doing between 9am and 11am when Ms Athanassiou was found. 'At the time he left his partner, Mr Johnston knew that members of the public were arranging for emergency help. Ms Athanassiou was left to die alone,' Mr Evans said, before adding the police file into her death would be left open.", "completion": "response:\n\nSophia Helen Athanassiou, 39, from Wellington, NZ, died on July 9, 2012 .\nWas left by partner Daniel Johnston while he looked for magic mushrooms .\nShe was 'red in the face and wheezy' last time Mr Johnston saw her .\nMs Athanassiou's cause of death was undetermined by an inquest ."}

A former Chelsea children's football coach has appeared in court accused of repeatedly raping a 12-year-old girl. Shane Hughes, who is believed to have worked for the Premier League club's Community Foundation, faces 14 counts of raping the girl. The alleged rapes dates back to 2011 and relate to one female victim, who is now aged 16. The 30-year-old, wearing a blue suit, with a white shirt and no tie, stood emotionless in the dock while Guildford Crown Court heard the charges laid out against him. Judge Christopher Critchlow said the charges against Hughes relate to when he was a football coach. He explained: 'These are allegation concerning his role as a football coach and what he did in that capacity.' The court was also told that Hughes, of Lenham in Kent will deny the charges against him. Gordon Ross, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant at the moment faces 14 charges of rape in relation to a claimant under the age of 13. 'The incidents date back to 2011 and thereafter. 'The early indication is that this will be a contested matter with a complete denial of any sexual activity.' Hughes was granted conditional bail to return to Guildford Crown Court on May 22 for a plea and case management hearing.

He is reportedly responding well to treatment. A witness told the Wirral Globe Mr Field appeared to have 'fainted' as the debate grew heated. A Labour Party spokesman told the newspaper: 'He was taken to hospital last night. 'He is responding well to treatment. He will be making his own statement in due course.' A statement on the Save Rock Ferry High School Facebook page reported Mr Field said: 'Thankfully, I was told he was sitting up and OK but he was being taken to hospital for a check up.

Filmed sitting on what seems to be his mother’s lap, Lincoln, who appears to be from America, is joined by his uncle Carson, who holds a purple balloon. After inhaling the helium, Carson says: ‘Hey Lincoln, how are you?’ in a sinister high-pitched voice while looking at his nephew. Reacting in shock to the sudden change in his uncle’s voice, Lincoln immediately looks stunned and his bottom lip begins to tremble. As his uncle starts giggling like a chipmunk it all becomes too much for baby Lincoln and he bursts into tears. So far so good: Lincoln sits on what appears to be his mother's lap while his uncle inhales helium from a purple balloon . Responding sympathetically, the youngster’s uncle says: ‘Oh no, no,’ but his high-pitched voice only makes things worse. Eventually, Lincoln is lifted away from his uncle, who laughs apologetically.

The runway appeared all white in the moments before landing, according to the report.

The area is famous for its polar bear dens, and Mr Slkillen managed to capture a set of heart-warming scenes. In the region, most polar bears build their dens around November and come out of hibernation in February. The photographer said that most bears in the park, hungry after months of being in their dens, are anxious to get hunting seals before the spring thaw. Having excitable young bears in tow, though, makes things a little trickier. He said: 'It's a fascinating scene to watch unfold. 'Polar bears live in a world of extremes, and yet despite their fearsome reputation show a remarkably touching side.

Patrick the wombat weighs in at an astonish 79lbs (36kg) despite the average for its species being somewhere between that figure and 32lbs (15kg). At 30 years old Patrick has also lived a lot longer than the expected age of a wombat. Patrick's handler, Julia Leonard, said: ‘We believe he is the oldest common wombat in captivity. ‘To live that long is pretty good going. In the wild they probably only average 10 to 15 years. ‘But you know, he has got a happy home, good food and lots of cuddles so he is thriving.’ A resident at the Ballarat Wildlife Park in Victoria, Australia, the wombat initially appears to be an average size when it first features in the video. Peek-a-boo! When Patrick the wombat first features in the video he appears to be an average size . But once it is picked up by its handler, the sheer size of the mammal is striking. However, according to Ms Leonard, the wombat is actually lighter than it used to be. ‘Well he was 40kg in his heyday. Of course, as you get older you lose a bit of weight so he is about 36kg now,' said Ms Leonard. According to Patrick's handler, Julia Leonard, in its 'heyday' the wombat weighed a whopping 40kg . Quite a handful! At 79lbs, Patrick is a lot heavier than the average wombat who weighs somewhere between that figure and 32lbs . Patrick has been in captivity nearly his entire life at the Ballarat Wildlife Park as – rather surprisingly – he couldn’t defend himself against other wombats in the wild. Hand-raised after being orphaned as a baby, the wombat is famous in the park for greeting visitors while being pushed around in a wheelbarrow – as seen in the video. With hundreds of thousands of fans, Patrick also has his own Facebook page and he was named the 3rd best 'city mascot' in the world back in 2014.

Updated guidance published yesterday insists that calls last for at least 30 minutes if they are offering personal care such as washing or dressing. The advice, published by NHS spending watchdog NICE, said 15-minute drop-ins should only be considered in certain cases such as checking if someone has taken their medication. Better care: Health watchdog NICE has published new guidelines in bid to stop 'drive-by' visits of carers (stock photo) In a sign of how bad things have become, guidelines have to spell out the care offered to the elderly – telling home helps to leave enough time to ‘talk to the person’. Care workers are also reminded to treat people with ‘empathy, courtesy, respect and in a dignified way’. The move marks a victory for the Daily Mail, which has highlighted care visits lasting as little as five minutes as part of our Dignity for the Elderly campaign. Last month a Mail investigation revealed that 70 per cent of councils are still allocating visits of just 15 minutes – with six authorities offering 200,000 slots of just five minutes. Some staff were even told not to chat because it wastes time, while visitors are sometimes poorly trained contractors or ill-suited to the job. In crisis: The recommendations come as Local Government Association say funding for social care is 'in crisis' (stock image) The guidance called on councils to ensure home care workers ‘have time to do their job without being rushed or compromising the dignity of the person who uses services’. It also attempts to stamp out the conveyor belt culture under which pensioners can be seen by ten or 15 different carers in a fortnight, saying ‘continuity of care’ must be a priority. Last night care minister Norman Lamb called on councils to adopt the guidance as soon as possible, saying that many authorities were ‘complicit’ in providing poor care. However, the Local Government Association, which represents councils, said money was just too short to end 15-minute care visits once and for all. Chairman David Sparks said funding for adult social care is ‘in crisis’. GPs are being urged to visit the elderly at least once a year to check they are not too cold, NICE guidance says. Meter readers could also check the temperature in pensioners’ homes and alert surgeries, it advises.", "completion": "response:\n\nNHS watchdog NICE published new guidelines for caring .\nPersonal care appointments for washing or dressing must be 30 minutes .\n15-minute drop-ins only appropriate for checking medication taken .\nVictory for Daily Mail's Dignity for the Elderly campaign ."}

The furious traveller shouted: 'I've been waiting for hours, I'm hungry', before assaulting the young cabin crew member, eyewitnesses said. The drama erupted aboard the British budget airline's flight from Geneva to Pristina in Kosovo this morning. A witness who was sitting near the man said: 'He shouted at the stewardess, then he stood up and punched her, and when she fell to the floor, he carried on hitting her.' Fellow passengers then stepped in to restrain the man, while the pilot diverted the plane to Fumincino airport in the Italian capital for 'security reasons'. EasyJet confirmed the attack and said its cabin crew member had been injured and her glasses had been broken (stock image) The stewardess later told Swiss newspaper 20 Minutes: 'I was totally shocked. I can't understand how anyone could react so violently over a sandwich.' Italian police arrested a man while the stewardess received medical attention at the scene, an eyewitness said. EasyJet confirmed the attack and said its cabin crew member had been injured and her glasses had been broken. A spokesman said: 'EasyJet can confirm that flight EZS1483 from Geneva to Pristina on 31 March diverted to Rome as a result of a passenger onboard behaving in a disruptive manner. 'The aircraft was met by the police on arrival in Rome and the passenger was arrested. 'The safety and wellbeing of passengers and crew is always easyJet's priority.

The dispute between the party’s Election chief Lucy Powell and Chief Whip Rosie Winterton flared up over an invitation to the Brit pop music awards on the night of a crucial Commons vote. Insiders say the row brought simmering tensions between the starkly contrasting pair – both rivals for Miliband’s ear – to a head. Flare-up: Election chief Lucy Powell, 40, left, and Chief Whip Rosie Winterton, 56, became embroiled in a dispute over Ms Powell's Brit Awards plans . It was caused by the desire of 40-year-old Ms Powell – who is tipped as a future Labour leader – to attend the Brits ‘pre-party’ where guests mingle with pop stars. But Ms Winterton, 56, ordered Ms Powell to stay at Westminster for a vote called by Miliband to ban MPs having second jobs. One source said: ‘Rosie told her she had no right to miss the vote to go hobnobbing with Madonna and Co.’ The argument reportedly intensified when Powell was told she had a special duty to be there because the ‘second jobs’ debate was partly the responsibility of Labour’s Shadow Cabinet Office team, which includes her. In the end, Ms Powell backed down and took part in the vote. But she still managed to get to the main Brits Awards event at London’s O2 Arena. Yorkshire-born Ms Winterton, who has never married and is renowned for her black leather boots, revels in her role in charge of party discipline. Commenting on the dispute, one source said: ‘Rosie told her she had no right to miss the vote to go hobnobbing with Madonna (pictured falling on stage) and Co’ at the Brits . She learned her backroom wheeler-dealing skills from her mentor and close friend John Prescott, who gave her first break in politics – as tea girl in his office in 1980. Stylish Lancashire-born brunette Ms Powell has had a meteoric rise through the party’s ranks. Only two years after becoming an MP, Miliband put her in charge of his Election campaign in November. A Labour MP said: ‘Lucy and Rosie are a generation apart and totally different in their approach to politics. ‘We have been waiting for this dust- up to occur.’ A Labour spokesman said last night: ‘There is no truth in this allegation.’", "completion": "response:\n\nElection chief Lucy Powell planned to mingle with stars at Brits pre-party .\nBut Chief Whip Rosie Winterton ordered her to stay at Westminster for vote .\nMs Powell, 40, backed down but still made it to music awards main event .\nInsiders say row brought simmering tensions between the contrasting pair ."}

The former Anfield man, a fellow countryman of Szczesny, believes that Arsene Wenger will always choose David Ospina and the Polish keeper should move on to improve his chances of playing for his country. 'It's a serious matter,' Dudek told Poland's TVP Sport. 'Fortunately, we have two other goalkeepers who are able to provide an adequate level in our goal. Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny has played second fiddle to David Ospina since the turn of the year . Jerzy Dudek believes that Szczesny should move on for the sake of his international career with Poland . 'In excellent form is Lukasz Fabianski and, on the other hand, Artur Boruc is very experienced. I think [Adam] Nawalka [Poland manager] will wait to make the decision until the very end. 'Wojciech is the least likely to play in the match with Ireland. If I were in his place, I would wonder whether there are still opportunities to arise at Arsenal and wouldn't wait as long as Fabianski, because you can see that Arsene Wenger is firmly set on David Ospina.' Fabianski (Swansea) and Boruc (on loan at Bournemouth from Southampton) are both goalkeepers with Premier League experience and, perhaps more importantly, regular first-team game-time this season. Ospina has impressed since taking the reigns from Szczesny after the Southampton game on January 1 . Dudek believes that Szczesny is below Lukasz Fabianski and Artur Boruc in the Poland pecking order . Szczesny started the season as Arsenal's No 1, but was dropped after being caught smoking in the showers at Southampton on New Year's Day. Since then, he has made just three appearances for the Gunners, all of which in the FA Cup.

If you've ever craved the smell of fast food all day long, Burger King has come up with the ultimate solution with the launch of a new burger-scented cologne. The cologne will supposedly imitate the signature aroma of the Whopper Burger, which consists of 100 per cent flame-grilled beef, freshly sliced onions, lettuce and mayonnaise.

There will also supposedly be a one day promotion, whereby every customer will receive a free Whopper Burger with their purchased perfume bottle. It's apt that the release of the perfume would fall on 1 April (April Fools' Day), and many have speculated that the 'launch' is in fact a global practical joke. While many people are doubtful of the launch's authenticity, the fast food chain insists that the upcoming release is not a hoax. In fact, this isn't the first time that it's launched a fragrance. In 2008, Burger King unveiled a men's spray, dubbed Flame, which was promoted as 'the scent of seduction with a hint of flame-broilled meat'. Flame was only available online and in certain stores in New York, and was discontinued shortly after its launch. April Fool's?

Di Maria  has endured an inconsistent debut season at United since moving from Real Madrid . Di Maria (right) has only shown glimpses of the skill that persuaded United to pay nearly £60million for him . The Argentina international started strongly under Louis van Gaal but has found starting opportunities limited  lately and was sent off in United's FA Cup defeat to Arsenal for pushing referee Michael Oliver in March. As for Pogba, the France midfielder is one of the most coveted players in Europe. He has been instrumental in helping Juventus establish a 14-point advantage at the summit of Serie A, while helping his side into the quarter-final of the Champions League, where they will meet Monaco. The 22-year-old, who was on United's books, has been linked with a move to Madrid but PSG could try to edge ahead of their European rivals with a big money offer to take Pogba back to France. Lacazette, meanwhile, has spearheaded Lyon's assault on the top of Ligue 1 and the club only trail PSG by a point in the table with 30 games played. Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba has reportedly caught the eye of Europe's top clubs with his displays . Pogba (centre) has been essential to Juventus as they have moved 14-points clear atop Serie A . Alexandre Lacazette has scored 23 goals for Lyon and is the top scorer in Ligue 1 .

Cruise Lines International Association data showed bookings fell 4.8 per cent, from 1.72million to 1.64million. Such holidays survived and even thrived during the economic downturn as a greater variety of destinations became available. Rule Britannia: Her Majesty the Queen christened Britain’s largest cruise liner last week as figures show cruises were less popular with British tourists last year . But the bubble may be bursting, with many put off by ever larger ships, having to fly abroad to the first port, and cost. Others may be deterred by health scares such as food poisoning or ebola. The CLIA said it was the first fall in a decade with a major factor being a lack of holidays starting in Britain or Europe meaning travellers had to fly further to pick up their cruise. That may change this year with the launch of several routes from ports like Southampton, including the massive liner Britannia christened by The Queen last week. The fall also means Britain loses its places as Europe's biggest cruisers, overtaken by the 1.77 million Germans who took a seabound voyage last year. Closer to home: Cruise bosses hope the launch of the Britannia, pictured, will lead to a spike in Brits booking cruises after figures from last year showed a dip in popularity .

The Airbus A330's crew first tried landing the plane around 7 a.m. Wednesday (8:30 p.m. ET Tuesday), getting very close to a runway but not touching down, according to passenger Deepak Malhotra. That was followed by an announcement that the aircraft couldn't land due to poor visibility. About 45 minutes later, though, the crew tried again. This time, the Turkish Airlines plane did get on the ground but it didn't stay on the runway, according to airport officials. The aircraft skidded off, screeching to a stop with its nose pitched down. Pictures showed passengers and crew going down evacuation slides and walking through heavy fog. Despite the rough landing, there were no reports of serious injuries, according to a Turkish Airlines spokesman. Still, the incident did manage to knock out air travel in and out of the Tribhuvan International Airport, the only way in for foreigners wanting to explore Mount Everest and other nearby peaks in the Himalayan Mountains. That's because part of the now-immobile Airbus A330 was covering a section of the runway. Nepal doesn't have the heavy-duty machinery required to move it, said Ratish Chandra Lal Suman, the head of the mountainous Asian nation's Civil Aviation Authority.

The written reasons for Evans' six-match ban were released by the FA on Thursday. The Manchester United defender and Newcastle striker Cisse were both charged after spitting at each other during the Red Devils' 1-0 victory on March 4 in an incident missed by referee Anthony Taylor. Newcastle's Papiss Cisse and Manchester United's Jonny Evans squared at St James' Park last week . Cisse has been banned for seven games, while Evans has received a six game suspension . Cisse accepted the charge and a seven-match ban - one extra because of a previous offence this season - but Evans insisted he had not intended to spit at the striker and contested it. The three members of the regulatory commission accepted 27-year-old Evans was the only person who could know his intent, but stated: 'It is clear that Mr Evans is looking directly and indeed aggressively at Mr Cisse. His lips are 'pursed' and he is close to Mr Cisse. 'If he was, as alleged to be the case, a person who 'habitually spits', then the commission were concerned as to why he did not turn his head away from Mr Cisse when so spitting. 'If that had been a family member or indeed another team member or his manager in front and below him would he still have carried out the same manoeuvre? Evans' actions have been described as 'simply disgusting' by the FA's regulatory committee . Both Evans and Cisse were charged and banned by the FA for spitting, but Cisse admitted the offence . 'Mr Evans had (and has) a duty of care, if spitting for whatever reason, not to direct the same in the general direction of an opponent, or indeed anyone else. The video clips clearly show that he failed in his duty of care. 'There may, in some quarters, be substantial sympathy for Mr Evans, but the video evidence shows that he did what he did, and the ordinary man in the street will find his action to be simply disgusting and should not be allowed in any walk of life, let alone on any football field.' The written report also reveals Manchester United questioned the length of the suspension but the commission did not consider there were any 'truly exceptional' circumstances to reduce it from the standard six matches.", "completion": "response:\n\nJonny Evans was banned for six games for spitting at Papiss Cisse .\nFA commission which found him guilty have published written reasons .\nReport said Evans was 'looking directly and indeed aggressively at Cisse'\n'The ordinary man in the street will find his action to be simply disgusting'"}

The letters by Admiral L. Ramdas and Prashant Bhushan are the ones that matter, and the issues they raised should be addressed. My objection is that instead of merely raising questions, people should contribute to the party by working for it. The problems have to be, and will be, addressed. It won’t take more than a month or so for the party to set everything right. Talking about the funds, I will say let the expenses and accounts reach the office. We have fought three elections in a year, which is too much for any small party. Every single issue raised is important for the party. The only problem is that this should not be done via the media; it needs to be done by holding internal talks. Mayank Gandhi should have demanded that the recordings and the minutes be made public in the meeting which he had attended. What is the meaning of simply raising questions? Every leader needs to think about it. If a volunteer is punished when he is wrong, even leaders should be held accountable. The party’s national executive was called only to tackle the problems. The issues raised are important, and people should take the onus to set the system right and not simply raise questions or write blogs. I genuinely feel Prashantji is a very respectful person. When he made those statements, my respect (for him) went down a bit. I would definitely like to see him as a leader of the party. We don’t expect him to make a mistake at all. There is no question of his marginalisation. He should be supported for a larger, better role by everyone. Ankit Lal, Ashutosh and Khetan need to apologise sincerely for what they have done. They need to be pulled up. Every volunteer wants transparency on accounts, candidate selection and other decisions. We had six months after the Lok Sabha polls. Why didn’t those who raise questions help carve out these mechanisms then? The camp system is wrong and if it exists, it should be demolished. I do not want to comment on Yogendra Yadav at all.

The revelations will come as a huge blow to the former French president, 60, who is aiming for re-election in two years. Adviser Patrick Buisson, 65, was credited with steering Mr Sarkozy into the Elysee Palace, where he served between 2007 and 2012. Nicolas Sarkozy's (left) most senior aide Patrick Buisson (right) regularly mocked him, it has been claimed . But a book called The Bad Genie claims Mr Buisson frequently mocked the 5ft 5in politician, who wore stacked heels, especially when with his third wife, former supermodel Carla Bruni. Mr Buisson, who is an expert on opinion polls, said Mr Sarkozy could 'do nothing without me' and would call him all the time. 'It was the Dwarf' or 'the Little One', Mr Buisson would tell colleagues after receiving a call from Mr Sarkozy. Mr Buisson was viewed as a 'compass' and 'genius' by Mr Sarkozy, despite also being referred to as a 'nutter' or 'airhead'. Sarkozy wore stacked heels, especially in the presence of his third wife, supermodel Carla Bruni . Mr Buisson would not think twice about slamming the phone down on Mr Sarkozy, saying: 'I'm having lunch, you're bothering me'. He would also put Mr Sarkozy's voice on speaker, and laugh about him with friends, saying: 'He can do nothing without me, Naboleon'. The nickname was a cross between 'Napoleon' - the legendary French leader - and the term 'nabot', which means dwarfish. Authors Ariane Chemin and Vanessa Schneider, who both write for Le Monde, said Sarkozy would phone Mr Buisson for 'reassurance' more than his wives. Mr Buisson fell out with Mr Sarkozy last year, after it emerged that he had recorded many of their conversations without the politician's consent. In one, Carla Bruni dubs her husband a 'kept man', thanks to her fortune amassed during her time as a model in the 1990s. Mr Sarkozy went on to sue his former mentor for around 70,000 pounds, saying: 'In my life I've known betrayal, but rarely one like this.' Mr Sarkozy was defeated by Francois Hollande, his detested Socialist rival, in 2012 after just one term in office.

The injunction by Nona Gaye, Frankie Gaye and Marvin Gaye III would prevent the copying, distributing and performing of the hit single featuring Robin Thicke, Pharrell Williams, and T.I. Williams and Thicke were ordered to pay nearly $7.4million to the three children after a jury determined last week that Blurred Lines copied elements of Gaye's song. Scroll down for video . Robin Thicke (left) and Pharrell Williams (right) were ordered to pay $7.4million after a jury ruled that their hit Blurred Lines copied elements of Marvin Gaye's (pictured center) 1977 song Got to Give It Up . Marvin Gaye's daughter, Nona Gaye, (left) and two of her siblings filed the injunction in court on Tuesday . Thicke's Blurred Lines was the biggest hit of 2013 and it sold more than seven million tracks in the United States . Gaye's family also sought Tuesday to amend the verdict to include rapper T.I. - whose real name is Clifford Joseph Harris Jr - as well as labels Universal Music, Interscope Records and Star Trak Entertainment. The injunction against Blurred Lines could give Gaye's family leverage to negotiate for royalties and other concessions, such as songwriting credits. The family said in a statement released Wednesday: 'With the digital age upon us, the threat of greater infringement looms for every artist. 'It is our wish that our dad's legacy, and all great music, past, present, and future, be enjoyed and protected, with the knowledge that adhering to copyright standards assures our musical treasures will always be valued.' The children claim the lawsuit could have been avoided if Thicke and Williams had spoken with the family before the song was released, The Wrap reported. The family said: 'Like most artists, they could have licensed and secured the song for appropriate usage. 'This did not happen. 'We would have welcomed a conversation with them before the release of their work. 'This also did not happen.' Blurred Lines was the biggest hit of 2013. It sold more than seven million tracks in the United States, topped the pop charts for months and earned two Grammy Award nominations.", "completion": "response:\n\nNona Gaye, Frankie Gaye and Marvin Gaye III filed injunction on Tuesday .\nChildren were awarded $7.4million in a copyright infringement lawsuit .\nSong by Pharrell and Robin Thicke took from 1977 hit Got to Give It Up .\nInjunction seeks to amend verdict to include rapper T.I. and record labels ."}

Staff at Venice High School in Los Angeles informed police of a suspected attack on a female student on Tuesday. However the LAPD found the sexual misconduct involved another student and had occurred frequently for more than a year. An investigation has since identified 14 suspects between the ages of 14 and 17 who have allegedly been involved in sexual activity at the school - some consensual and some not. Investigation: Nine students at Venice High School in Los Angeles have been arrested in connection with sexual assaults on two underage girls dating back to 2013 . Eight youngsters from the school were arrested on Friday while another was arrested at another location. The suspected attacks are believed to have occurred on and off campus and date back to around December 2013. However the majority  are believed to have taken place in the last two months. A statement by the LAPD read: 'In an effort to protect the victims, all subjects were arrested at Venice High School and transported to Pacific Area Station for booking. 'The investigation is still ongoing and detectives will continue to interview all parties involved as well as collect any additional evidence.' A source for the LA Times said the accusations involves the male students working together to pressure girls into having sex. Los Angeles Schools Police Chief Steve Zimmerman told the media: 'When we have information about issues that concerning student safety and issues pertained to the school as a whole, we will do everything to ensure that behavior doesn't happen.' The police department confirmed rape wasn't involved but said it involved forced sexual assault. Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent Ramon Cortines told The Times the students' parents had been notified and counselors were on campus to assist any other students. He said: 'This is a painful moment for Venice High School, and this district. I want you to know that no sexual misconduct of any kind by students or staff will ever be tolerated in L.A.

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the package will include first aid kits, night vision goggles, helmets, GPS (global positioning system) units and 'ruggedised' laptops. The announcement comes a day after Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond flew to the eastern European country's capital Kiev for talks with Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk and foreign minister Pavlo Klimkin. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the UK is sending more non-lethal aid to Ukraine . In a written statement to the House of Commons, Mr Fallon said that the UK's gift came in response to a request from Kiev for help with basic equipment, supplies of which have been depleted by months of instability caused by Russian-backed separatists in the east of the country. Mr Fallon said: 'This Government is committed to supporting Ukraine's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. As a result of their prolonged engagement in this conflict, the Ukrainians face a serious shortage of basic equipment, and have requested help. 'Our proposed gift of non-lethal equipment is designed to prevent further Ukrainian fatalities and casualties and to help improve situational awareness on the ground.'

We very much hope it will help  end the conflict. 'However, fighting has not ceased in some areas and there continues to be  fatalities and casualties amongst the Ukrainian armed forces.'

Wales and Real Madrid star Gareth Bale (centre) gets through some speed work on Wednesday . Bale and his Welsh team-mates are gearing up for Saturday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Israel . But Gutman said: ‘We don’t have enough strong players to kick him out. We are going to play as a team, one unit, not to give space. We have to put the players close together on the pitch.’ Bale’s Real team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo failed to score against Israel in two games during qualification for last year’s World Cup, with Maccabi Tel Aviv midfielder Sheran Yeini shackling the Portugal star. But Guttman responded with sarcasm when asked if the trick could be repeated. ‘We called Cristiano to ask how to do the same against Bale but he did not answer, unfortunately,’ he laughed. Israel coach Eli Guttman speaks to the media ahead of Saturday's meeting with Wales . Wales manager Chris Coleman said Bale would cope even if Israel resorted to the rough stuff. ‘He has played most of his football in the Premier League, the most physically demanding in the world,’ said Coleman. ‘He has come through Madrid derbies and Clasicos in Spain. All the focus will be on him but we have a good squad and our strength is our togetherness.’ Bale is set to be handed a free role tonight, after fierce criticism of his form by media and supporters in Madrid. Coleman insisted there had been no mention from Bale of Madrid during the week’s training, however, and his best player was unaffected by the furore. ‘I cannot see any difference in him,’ said Coleman. ‘If I thought it was bothering him, we would have talked about it. We have not mentioned Real Madrid, we have only talked about Wales and this game.

Councils across the country are rushing to snap up the new high-tech manhole covers as they try to curb the theft of the old, low-tech versions, according to the People's Daily Online. The seemingly drastic measure was taken after previous anti-theft measures - chaining the manhole covers to street lamps - left officials red-faced, turning for sale in various places around the world. High tech: The new manhole covers are fitted with tracking devices to help authorities find the thieves . Problem: More than 240,000 manholes were stolen in Beijing over a 10 year period, thanks to metal values . The chains also proved unpopular, with many pointing out they could easily be cut, and were dangerous for people walking along the street. One man has even demanded compensation after falling flat on his face, thanks to the chain. It is hoped these new covers, which were developed by a Chinese tech company, will not only put would-be thieves off stealing the items, but also help track those who do give into temptation. The covers, along with drain grills, can fetch high prices on the black market, as the price of scrap metal has spiraled in recent years. It has been estimated that more than 240,000 manhole covers were stolen from Beijing's streets in the 10 years to 2013 alone. Measures: Previous attempts at curbing thefts - like tying the manholes to lamp posts - have not worked . The new covers, designed to have shock absorption and noise reduction features, are made out of a metal with a far lower value, as a further deterrent. A test batch of 100 smart manhole covers will be placed on streets in the city of Hangzhou this month,  and - if it is a success - they will be added throughout the city. But it is not just about the money. Officials have revealed there is a safety concern motivating their purchases as well, as people could trip on an upturned manhole. Tao Xiaomin, of Hangzhou urban management office, explained: 'When a cover is moved and the tilt angle is greater than 15 degrees, the tag will send an alarm signal to us.'", "completion": "response:\n\nNew high-tech covers hope to curb the number of thefts on China's streets .\nMore than 240,000 manhole covers stolen in Beijing over a 10-year period .\nAuthorities previously tried chaining them to lamp posts to prevent thefts .\nBut people derided the idea as 'stupid' because thieves just cut the chains ."}

Never one to miss a media opportunity, Trump, the owner of the Blue Monster course in Florida, got a scuba diver to retrieve the 3-iron club which world No. 1 McIlroy had thought he had seen the last of during Friday's second round at the WGC-Cadillac Championship. The 68-year-old American entrepreneur presented it to McIlroy before his final round Sunday, telling him that it was unlucky to continue playing with 13 clubs as against the usual 14 allowed under golf's rules. \"He's never one to miss an opportunity,\" McIlroy told the official PGA Tour website after his round. \"It was fine. It was good fun.\" Not that opportunity knocked for McIlroy when he chose the 3-iron to play his third shot to the 18th and final hole of the tournament and promptly found the water again. The Northern Irishman feigned to repeat his earlier antics, before placing it back in the bag. His mistake led to a double bogey six and left him tied for ninth at one-under-par, eight shots behind winner Dustin Johnson. McIlroy had promised to return the club to Trump after the round and was as good as his word. \"We're thinking about auctioning it for charity or doing a trophy case for Doral, putting it on a beautiful mount,\" Trump said. Johnson is looking set to be one of McIlroy's main rivals in the first major of the season, the U.S. Masters at Augusta, next month and his victory completed a triumphant comeback to the PGA Tour. The 30-year-old American took a six-month break from the Tour last July to cope with \"personal problems\" and returned earlier this year. Johnson finished with a three-under 69 in testing conditions to leave him one ahead of long-time leader JB Holmes and two clear of Bubba Watson, the reigning Masters champion.

Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone has signed a contract extension at the club until 2020 . Simeone has pledged his future to Atletico for the next five years, with the aim of building an empire .

In life it is difficult to choose sometimes but I am sure about the decision I have taken.’ Confirmation of Simeone’s loyalty to the club where he won La Liga last season will disappoint a clutch of Premier League clubs interested in his services but the deal is believed to include a clause that would allow him to leave for a reduced compensation package if he did so at the end of any given season.

But today another accessory won the day - the enormous new 'smart watch' festooning the Commander-in-Chief's wrist. Obama was seen today wearing the hefty item - a Fitbit Surge device - as he walked around D.C. and met with Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny, and later lunched with congressmen on Capitol Hill. Scroll down for video . New accessory: Obama sported the watch at a meeting today with Prime Minister Enda Kenny of Ireland . Check it: Obama has recently said that he was considering getting a Fitbit, or its rival the Apple watch . Device: The Fitbit Surge, pictured above in publicity photos, monitors heart rate, sleep and even the location of those that wear it . The Fitbit surge is an advanced piece of wearable technology that constantly monitors the body of the person wearing it. It uses LED sensors to measure heart rate, and can function as a calorie counter and GPS device. It also tells the time. The Surge model is the largest and most sophisticated Fitbit model, and sells for around $250. Obama has previous expressed his interest in emergent 'wearable' technology. In a February interview with Re/code, he seemed torn between getting a Fitbit and an Apple watch. Testing it out: Obama . Suiting up: Obama was pictured earlier today with the watch while getting dressed . He said: 'I don’t have a Fitbit yet, but I work out hard. Word is these Apple Watches might be a good companion for my workouts. So I’m gonna see, I’m gonna test it out.' The testing had evidently begun by Tuesday, when Obama prominently wore the device for his public engagements. Fitbit enthusiasts are encouraged to even wear their device to sleep, where it collects data while the subject is unconscious, and can wake them up with silent, vibrating alarms. One feature the President may be particularly keen on is that the device is programmable to have a golf mode. Fitbits are set up to communicate with mobile devices regularly to store the data they collect - however the President is only allowed a Blackberry because of security concerns, which is incompatible with his new toy.

Although Andy Murray immediately expressed a desire to play the July tie on a grass court, the fact that neither Wimbledon nor the Queen’s Club will be available is believed to be pushing decision makers towards a return to the Emirates Arena. Andy Murray celebrates extravagantly during his straight sets win over John Isner on Sunday . Great Britain supporters would relish supporting Murray and Co in Glasgow again in July . All three day's of Davis Cup action at the Emirates Arena were sold out in a matter of minutes . The only available outdoor grass arena with a big enough capacity is in Eastbourne - but neither the players nor captain Leon Smith are keen on playing at a venue renowned for a lack of atmosphere. The noise and passion of the Scottish crowd played a huge part in the weekend win over the USA, sparking a debate within the LTA over whether that X factor may outweigh any disadvantage that comes from not playing on grass. While Murray prefers it to the indoor hard court, he would be favourite to beat any of his French opponents on any surface – while British No 2 James Ward is actually better when he moves on to the artificial surface, potentially the decisive factor when the final call is made. GB captain Leon Smith doubts the chances of Glasgow being able to create a larger grass-court venue .

Murray (middle) is looked on in envy by his fellow GB team-mates after securing a tie against France . Sportsmail understands that the city authorities are willing to leave the July 17-19 dates clear in the hope of getting the nod over the coming week or so. Unfortunately, because it takes about a week to set up the court, a Bette Midler concert would rule out taking the quarter-final to The Hydro, the city’s biggest indoor venue. But a return to the Emirates, which hosted over 21,000 fans over three days, is very much on the cards. Although no one from Glasgow Life would comment on their plans yesterday, a spokesman said: ‘The atmosphere at the weekend was electric and Glasgow proved, once again, why we are one of the world’s top sporting cities. Any decision on hosting future Davis Cup ties would be for the LTA.’", "completion": "response:\n\nGreat Britain face France in the Davis Cup quarter finals in July .\nThis tie could be held in Glasgow if GB decide atmosphere outweighs the desire to play on a grass court .\nAndy Murray admits his preference is grass, but that playing in Glasgow again with the crowd behind them could be crucial ."}

The London-based human rights group said that a first bill, which has already been approved once by parliament, would restrict access to contraception, forcing women into unsafe backstreet abortions. It said the second draft law, which is to go before parliament next month, would close many jobs to women who choose not to or are unable to have children. Iran is seeking to double its population to 150 million by 2065 . 'The proposed laws will entrench discriminatory practices and set the rights of women and girls in Iran back by decades,' said Amnesty's deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa, Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui. 'The authorities are promoting a dangerous culture in which women are stripped of key rights and viewed as baby-making machines rather than human beings with fundamental rights to make choices about their own bodies and lives.' The draft legislation comes in response to a call by supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to double Iran's population to 150 million within 50 years. Iranian officials have expressed alarm at its ageing population, with an official at the national birth registry, Mohammad Nazemi Ardekani, warning last April the population growth rate could fall to zero 'within 30 years'. The bill, which is now undergoing amendment, would ban voluntary sterilisation and end state subsidies for contraceptive services. Draft legislation will put men and women in Iran who can have children to the top of the priority list for jobs . Amnesty said it would inevitably lead to an increase in backstreet terminations in a country where abortion is illegal except in very limited circumstances. The second bill would require both public and private employers to give priority to men and women with children when hiring for certain jobs. It would also make divorce more difficult and restrict intervention by the state in family disputes, which Amnesty said would expose women to increased risks of domestic violence. Women currently make up around 60 percent of university students in Iran and 10 percent of economically active women are employed, according to official figures.", "completion": "response:\n\nDraft legislation aimed at boosting a flagging birth rate  has come under fire .\nIran is seeking to double its population to 150million by 2065 .\nIt wants to restrict contraception access and prioritise jobs for the fertile .\nAmnesty says the laws will set rights of women back decades ."}

The alleged incident occurred on a 93-degree day in late June 2014. Police say they reviewed footage from the A Step Above Childcare in Lakewood Ranch after the little boy's mother complained he came home with blisters on the bottom of his feet. Stephany Gomez-Garrido, 27, a teacher at the center, claimed the infant didn't participate in outside activities at the school's 'waterpark' - a cemented area where sprinklers run -  because he was not wearing the proper shoes. However the cameras showed otherwise, according to The Herald-Tribune. Charged: Stephany Gomez-Garrido, 27, has been accused of neglect for letting a one-year-old boy in her care play outside on a hot summer day without shoes or socks on, causing second-degree burns to his feet . The boy can reportedly be seen leaving the classroom without shoes on. While he doesn't appear to have entered the waterpark area, he was playing on a paved walking that lead to the area. The footage then shows him returning to the classroom 30 minutes in Gomez-Garrido's arms crying, kicking and grabbing his feet. Gomez-Garrido can be seen attending to the child, looking at his feet at least twice, before putting shoes and socks on him. She can then be seen placing him on a seat, where he remained for the rest of the afternoon. Police say the boy ran from the classroom at 1.42pm and was picked up by his mother at about 4pm. Gomez-Garrido told detectives a few days later she did not let him play outside. However she  later admitted that she was unable to tend to the infant because she was supervising other children in the waterpark and was the only teacher assigned to the area that day, according to WTSP. Scene: The alleged neglect occurred at the A Step Above Childcare in Lakewood Ranch in late June 2014 . An investigation however determined that Gomez-Garrido knew the toddler was playing on the hot surfaces outside and did nothing about it. Police say the child needed medical attention, with his burns determined to be second-degree, and that she failed to noitify his mother. Gomez-Garrido is charged with neglect of a child without great bodily harm. She is being held without bond at the Sarasota County Jail.", "completion": "response:\n\nStephany Gomez-Garrido, 27, charged with neglect of a child without great bodily harm in Sarasota, Florida .\nPolice say child played for 30 minutes on hot concrete with no shoes .\nIt was a 92-degree day and the teacher failed to properly supervise .\nScene was caught on camera at the A Step Above Childhood center ."}

He has got a lot of qualities really, it’s just getting them out of him on a consistent basis. But he has got that in his locker, maybe it’s just taken him and a few of the new signings time to adapt to the Premier League.' Herrera set up Mata's first goal against Liverpool with an inch-perfect pass and the 25-year-old acquisition from Athletic Bilbao has shown signs of being able to provide a greater tempo to United's play. 'He is quite good defensively and, when I watch him, I can see he has a lot of energy and he does like to get involved' added Robson. 'What I like about him is that, when people are on the ball, he is always on the move to try and receive the pass.'

The former pace attack leader of Australia's all-conquering Test team in the early 2000s has habitually forecast thrashings for England in the past, and has been embarrassed when Australia have not performed as he expected, notably in the 2005 series. He played a part in Australia triumphing 5-0 Down Under in 2006-07, and again envisaged the same result in England in 2009, only for Andrew Strauss to lead the home side to their triumph. Glenn McGrath has predicted a 5-0 whitewash for Australia when they travel to England this summer . McGrath was a constant tormentor of England in Ashes series during his playing days . Peter Moores' side have suffered a terrible World Cup but will hope to bounce back in Test cricket . McGrath had more recently refrained from trumpeting Australia as unbeatable by England, even prior to their 5-0 demolition job in 2013-14, but that is how he again positions Michael Clarke's Test team. With England toiling to sorry effect at the World Cup, McGrath is looking to the summer and sees more misery on the cards when ousted limited-overs skipper Alastair Cook returns to take the helm of the five-day team. He told BBC Sport: 'If the Australian team keeps playing as they are, they're going to go to England full of confidence. England were knocked out of the World Cup by Bangladesh last week, and McGrath can't see them improving . During his playing days McGrath made a habit of predicting whitewashes, and was not always proved right . 'I can't see England beating them and I'm more than happy to predict 5-0.' McGrath, 45, expects the World Cup debacle to be followed by change in the England camp. He said: 'I thought they struggled to take wickets or build up any pressure and they didn't look potent at all. 'There are going to be changes, whether it's coaching or the players.

The pub-with-rooms phenomena continues apace in London - and this is a classic of the genre, executed with style and panache by a couple of twentysomethings who met at Leeds University. This is their third Artist Residence (Brighton and Penzance are up and running), in what used to be a traditional boozer in Pimlico, a short walk from Victoria Station. If the bones of a building are important, here they're as good as they get. A bright splash of colour on the canvas: Artist Residence has brought a dash of flair to an old pub . Built by Thomas Cubitt in 1852, the grand, stuccoed house is on four floors - five if you count the basement, where there's a dimly lit bar and sitting room for hotel guests. I feel good the moment I walk in. There is no fuss at reception and, unlike The Orange nearby, there is a separate entrance for those staying the night, so you don't have to shout your name at the bar or get handed a packet of crisps rather than your room key. I've booked a Small Plus room, but am upgraded to The Loft because not many of the ten rooms are occupied. Everything about The Loft is charming: the wooden floors and panelled walls, bare brick, white paint. The bedhead is a gate and the lights (all on dimmers) are industrial, with Sixties anglepoise lamps on the bedside tables. The cupboard must have been reclaimed from an office. In fact, reclamation seems to be a theme. 'The countryside comes to town' is another. The bathroom is part of the bedroom, with a separate shower and enclosed loo. Two sturdy sash windows look terrific and, hallelujah, you can open them. The restaurant is called 64 Degrees. The idea is that the chefs are part of the eating experience, especially if you sit at the bar, as I do. Small plates of this and that are the order of the day under three sections: veg, fish and meat, with four options for each. Haddock gyoza, pear and fennel has me leaning over the bar and asking one of the chefs for an explanation. There are no side dishes of any description - and no carbs as far as I can see. Dr Atkins would feel at home. There's a bubbly, unpretentious atmosphere, though I would expect proper napkins rather than paper jobbies at these prices. Frankly, that's about the only criticism I can muster. Artist Residence . 52 Cambridge Street . London . SW1V 4QQ . 020 7931 8946 . www.artistresidencelondon.co.uk . Doubles from £150, room only.

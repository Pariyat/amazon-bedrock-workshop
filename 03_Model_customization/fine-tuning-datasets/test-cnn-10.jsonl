Mayweather was photographed taking the scales for the WBC’s mandatory weight check 30 days before a world title fight. The boxers are required to weigh no more than 10 per cent in excess of the 147 lb welter limit. Floyd Mayweather is down to within three-and-a-half pounds of the welterweight limit ahead of mega-fight . The electronic machine showed Mayweather at 150.5 lbs. There was a modicum of surplus fat at the sides of his waist but he looks well on track with his conditioning. Pacquiao is also understood to be comfortably within the 30-day stipulation. The checks are designed to prevent boxers draining off too much poundage at the last minute, which increases the risk of brain damage through fluid loss. Mayweather is looking to extend his 47-fight unbeaten streak when he meets Pacquiao next month . Both men will weigh-in again seven days before the fight, when they must be within five per cent of the welterweight limit.

An airport luggage conveyor belt has a novel way of separating bags into the correct queues - but it's a somewhat cut and thrust job. As the suitcases whizz round on the belt, out of nowhere a mechanical arm slams into the bags and and thrusts them onto a lower track. The red and black luggage moves along the conveyor after being taken from the plane . Suddenly the mechanical arm springs into action giving the luggage some brute force . And with a sharp movement, the red and black case is passed down onto a lower conveyor belt . The mechanism appears to work on a sensor system, ensuring it strikes out at the centre of the luggage so as to not spin it, but what might shock is the force of the action. It is not known where this video was taken, although it is believed to be an international airport. However baggage pushers like this are used at airports all over the world, with Dutch company Vanderlande market leaders in the machinery. Their 'Parallel Pusher,' similar to the one in this video, is a widely used horizontal divert pusher that sorts single bags to one destination only. When the pusher is activated, a pusher plate operates at 90 degrees to the transport direction and pushes the bag into a destination or onto a connection conveyor. This suitcase is set for a ride on a different conveyor in a matter of seconds . The arm extends out to separate the luggage in the hope it arrives with its owner . The video, after being uploaded to YouTube, has been met with mixed responses. User Stephanie O wrote: 'This is the real reason why your baggage is destroyed at the airport', while Sarah Cartwright added: 'Vicious airport baggage packer.' DMTRYP says what most people would think on viewing the video, writing: 'Hope none of the souvenirs were made out of glass or ceramics.'", "completion": "response:\n\nMachines are used around the world for sorting luggage onto conveyors .\nVideo shows swift and powerful mechanical arm separating suitcases .\nSimilar to the 'Parallel Pusher' developed by leading Dutch company ."}

Labour candidate Tulip Siddiq (left) was last night accused of failing to tell voters that she met Vladimir Putin (right) in Moscow two years ago . But the Tories last night accused Ms Siddiq of trying to conceal her extraordinary links to Putin and Sheikh Hasina. They claimed she appears to have gone to great lengths to cover up her trip in January 2013 – just six months before she won a hotly-contested Labour selection contest in Hampstead – and her links with Hasina. The Tories also said she had deleted postings and photographs on her blog which showed how she campaigned to get her aunt re-elected. And they questioned why her 1,200-word official Labour profile made no mention of Putin, the arms deal or being a member of a ruling Bangladeshi dynasty. A Tory official said: 'It seems very odd that Ms Siddiq has appeared to try to conceal the most interesting parts of her political life.' Retiring Labour MP Glenda Jackson won Hampstead with a majority of just 42 in 2010. Last night a Labour spokesman said: 'Tulip is proud of her background and has always been very open about it.' As for the photograph, the spokesman said: 'Tulip was totally separate from any official delegation but was invited to an event with her family.'

The stark warning comes from General Keith Alexander, the retired four-star general and former chief of the National Security Agency. 'The greatest risk is a catastrophic attack on the energy infrastructure. We are not prepared for that,' he warned. Scroll down for video . Former NSA chief General Keith Alexander has warned that the U.S. and her allies are at an ever growing risk of a systemic cyber-assault, with energy infrastructure likely to be hacker's prime target . Alexander, who led the U.S. battle against cyber-threats for much of the last decade, was speaking at a private dinner held by IHS CERAWeek in Texas last week, reports the Daily Telegraph. He envisioned a worst case-scenario where hackers targeted oil refineries, power stations, and the electric grid. The payments nexus of the major banks could also be paralysed he warned. 'We need something like an integrated air-defence system for the whole energy sector,' he said. Alexander listed five countries able to conduct cyber-warfare at the highest level: the US, UK, Israel, Russia and Iran. The current NSA chief Michael Rogers testified late last year that China is capable of cyber-attacks that could cause 'catastrophic failures' of the water system or the electricity grid. There is no suggestion that China has an intention to use its power to damage US infrastructure. NSA officials are less confident that Iran will show self-restraint. Alexander also voice his concern about the hacking threat from a terrorist organization such as ISIS. He said that the U.S. and her allies had failed to check the advance of ISIS and its expanding network of franchises across the Middle East.", "completion": "response:\n\nGeneral Keith Alexander has warned that the U.S. and her allies are at an ever growing risk of a systemic cyber-assault .\nHe predicts that energy infrastructure would be hacker's prime target .\n'We are not prepared for that,' he warned in Texas last week .\nAlso voiced his concerns about the hacking threat from a terrorist organization such as ISIS ."}

But one young elephant decided to go it alone, when it walked alongside its herd and even broke their chain. Captured at Whipsnade Zoo, the video shows keepers assisting six elephants along a path – five of which walk in single file. The baby elephant can be seen walking alongside its herd, which travel in a single file line . As the first three elephants move from the shot, the fourth – a smaller elephant – is flanked by a baby. It stops to dawdle as it reaches the grass and uses its trunk to pick something up off the floor before setting off again. Finding itself in between the last two elephants as it begins walking, the young mammal’s  back gets in the way and causes the link to break. The baby elephant stops to dawdle and picks something up from the floor with its trunk . It then rather cheekily forces its way into the line at the expense of the huge – and rather understanding – elephant behind it. Uploading the video to Newsflare, the filmmaker wrote: ‘We had just come out of the bear’s exhibit at Whipsnade Zoo when we saw elephants being led by zookeepers along the road, it was so amazing and unexpected. ‘I quickly grabbed my camera to take photos and managed to get a video of them holding each other’s tails, I had never seen elephants hold their tails in a line before, it was quite remarkable. The baby elephant goes to start walking once more and manages to break the elephant chain with its back . ‘The little baby elephant was constantly stopping or running off to the frustration of the other elephants, it was hilarious to watch him being put in his place.’ Whipsnade Zoo opened in 1931 and was originally known as Whipsnade Wild Animal Park. Located at Whipsnade, near Dunstable in Bedfordshire, the zoo has a land area of 600 acres and, as of 2012, was home to 2,741.
